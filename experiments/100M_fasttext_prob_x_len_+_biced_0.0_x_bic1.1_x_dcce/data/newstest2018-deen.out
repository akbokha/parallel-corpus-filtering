Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution where young people are supposed to meet today .
&quot; a Gru@@ ft@@ kapelle , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that already had to rain because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer by Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria to the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very informative . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet that one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; the large overview map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; &quot; papers . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
&quot; Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria , of course for military purposes . &quot;
&quot; even though the French troops finally ended up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying department . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional She@@ et for Munich originates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is the send@@ ling which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; the consi@@ gn@@ ment was used 21 years after the map was created , in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered straps from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive &quot; &quot; from which the land tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots are no longer farmers there today - but farmers of the &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; plant . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the field of the current district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ma@@ dness . &quot;
in 18@@ 58 / 59 there was the Munich @-@ based district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to employ force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular pension in hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
young people meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich on the grounds of the former prison institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - based on the original construction of the asylum @-@ institution , was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as the &quot; main square &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the &quot; Kauf@@ inger@@ straße &quot; was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a great remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ thing Promotion has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ ameri@@ can travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state enforcement agencies that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim for minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during his journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime . &quot;
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more common than the White House .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people have to be ready , whether it is buying money or letting the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report Programme of the F@@ BI , which classi@@ fy the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations , which according to the AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stak@@ eholder groups have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ wizard project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on site .
&quot; at the Land@@ grab@@ enhof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives from the CD@@ U town hall met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his farm , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing route for the milk of its cows , as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is exclusively region@@ als .
&quot; as he is also the chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot;
I cannot manage profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
&quot; green areas care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ lizers , even if he does not conduct a bio@@ economy . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the for@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers stand for the promotion of@@ ten@@ times in criticism
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
&quot; thus , the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs of the total cost of € 71 500 were promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture @-@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land women . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiss also stood firm : &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Protection Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding of f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveyed material lab@@ elled by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the fen@@ cing surface must not be feasible ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ hen project in 2018 . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the most carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dr@@ astically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller was not attacking the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he assumed their significance , and in particular the significance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to address a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the vibr@@ ating words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable apost@@ asy &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA are not welcome .
&quot; this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America . &quot;
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out image .
&quot; Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she herself gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus was changing the significance of the statue , the people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame into the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty moves ahead . &quot;
it is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch will not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , w@@ ret@@ ched , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp have ever wanted to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch will not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship title will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; something special has been developed in Scotland , &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals con@@ ten@@ ders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ovo - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to team captain by the team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that one should watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved with the medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb up to Po@@ dien . &quot;
what is my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the bur@@ ge@@ oning of voters
the father of our country knew something from a bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he compla@@ ined in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we will be led like sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular . &quot;
it has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters and to debate his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is designated as official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . she was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely comment that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news show &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the governor referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical mor@@ als or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers appeared between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers fell on his leadership . &quot;
&quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain were overwhel@@ med by his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how to achieve fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending champi@@ onships for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken from the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home ground . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m happy about how this has gone .
&quot; the trio in the field is the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce is one of the six Sc@@ ots in the field , others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer thanks to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) came to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; said He@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably close to time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze &apos;s director . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house @-@ connections the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , since there is much se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot;
the road is closed and only the scheduled buses are authorized to go through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the quiet Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the sol@@ dered tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many people drink hard , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was included in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule quickly appe@@ aled against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers from it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split up in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and of corrugated iron roofs that have been converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust . &quot;
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here because journalists and practically no for@@ eig@@ ner .
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst childhood and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars , the company also boasts wood resources . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the US to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 have been killed and thousands have been tortured , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the UN Human Rights Commission .
&quot; last year alone , Indon@@ esian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone . &quot;
&quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week has incidents , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bolts have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian but demographic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese cant@@ e@@ ens selling fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell h@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local US , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura province capital . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Papua - Mama @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua , where it cost her market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed and today the locals feel fool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ ai , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an impulse on their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their rif@@ le , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
&quot; one child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so hard hit that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and performed the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continually and a bird song im@@ iti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to cast stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said , TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ aking still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in was the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ port@@ edly said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station , because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ li@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings took place on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; by Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances of Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Papua .
&quot; instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ ery un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ak@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , 24 @-@ year old ra@@ viol@@ anus , Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to be held ac@@ countable and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , living in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the country , by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is also out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the majority of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new immigrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development was not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fist states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting ) . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , who also participated in the session , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia will have another presidential election 2019 , but the US will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ i , Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ ot@@ gun made a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ kles with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest living towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that , in only two years , swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is , inci@@ dentally , called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.@@ 00 AM local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs GMT ) and the building cooled down .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions concerning the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the covering , the outer covering for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding in the Gren@@ fell Tower in June might have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the two @-@ third majority of the Davis Cup singles were not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority for this sport . &quot;
&quot; although they often have very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics , the traditional competition will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; at 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote was agreed , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already come to pass the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in the future , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training grounds etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring forbidden objects into the plane , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among airlines found that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items passed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had late discovered that they were mistakenly jour@@ ne@@ ying with guns , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey for more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers should rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent said , know@@ ingly contributed items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it had questioned travellers around the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ tent smu@@ g@@ gling goods had been brought by airport security , and how many could have done it intentionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry out safety , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids are allowed to carry them with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items banned by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought the T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 , &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to provide you with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that some of the customers have already with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed yet another , less gl@@ it@@ tering number for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition has just started . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k cle@@ ars : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations have to be made in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be - 500@@ ,000 - one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a Model 3 today , can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if it comes to major delays , the bol@@ dness of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flocks .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of the hes@@ itation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his former position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a time limit on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for soil near o@@ zone .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan , and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local choices or obstruc@@ ting economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a prior to his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regul@@ ations which oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously .
&quot; however , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &apos; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &apos; to ensure that the rules are based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group wanted to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ bl@@ ers to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the &quot; &quot; Württem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ gent &quot; &quot; : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ our including the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document according to the document , in addition to the former parish church , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt of Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , besides the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the village &apos;s glorious nucleus . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 will under@@ pin these historical facts .
the privilege of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval self @-@ church right .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , ref@@ unded and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church . &quot;
this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was fragile at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell parts were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops camped near the church . &quot;
they pulled out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the cemetery of the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead of hearing @-@ silence .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm collap@@ sed and half collap@@ sed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn maintain the Hil@@ arius facility as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery in St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , the local leader , speaks the final word . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to finish the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; ask the organisers the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and hearing schwei@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly obliged to the home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms . &quot;
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction , and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the Bo@@ is@@ heim association has called on Council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it would be illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; the landscape . &quot;
&quot; although a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to use a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted permission is still illegal and therefore also to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council has again decided to take the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been entered into the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle asks them to check the matter again .
&quot; however , it is not expected that the procedure will be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large grounds . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this is roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re hopes to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies after terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more persons were injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her passenger car , drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person . &quot;
city and tra@@ der plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ berg and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre . &quot;
the trade association and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping centre in the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers the own city apart from the usual supermarket product . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training positions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite to the &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night Shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action @-@ weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city center . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; on the well @-@ known Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and land@@ lords to actively participate . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials will be re@@ opened or re@@ opened . &quot;
this includes both spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and clubs . &quot;
king in the spring said that I had to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network .
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day for the first time took part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote &quot; the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the au@@ spices of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour as his direct environment .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new other people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them severely wounded . &quot;
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade on Wednesday ( local time ) an infringement was in critical condition .
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first missing was found dead later .
&quot; in the case of the dead , it was an employee of the school . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of accident , the authorities assumed work on a gas line . &quot;
only a few people stayed in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
tru@@ mp used to push through in@@ feed tran@@ scripts from telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp ordered a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President compla@@ ined that he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
&quot; tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published , revealing a ten@@ se exchange . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that had been im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the USA . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull . &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ saw Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block their path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked veri@@ fying through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was torn apart from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just one night . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience sounded very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights have come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirty spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , the hind@@ ran@@ ce serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual remembrance of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician places a blanket over the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although susp@@ ects have been on free foot@@ ing for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in favour of their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmers , Roger Mal@@ com wore a white landed propriet@@ or , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b was surrounded by a mo@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual re @-@ appointment of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her presentation is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build relationships with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ ren Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester scre@@ aming and pressing him , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , &apos; n --@@ he , win@@ king of my property ! &apos; &quot;
the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ating .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , always smiling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman suffering from mour@@ ning is about the corp@@ ses of the actors , making Bil@@ lie &apos;s holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice broke out with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as &apos;s oppres@@ sive humidity every eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to get closer and inspec@@ ting the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy m@@ um@@ bles as if he wants to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ hid embra@@ ces two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in their arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience joins the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta talks about the job with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called Police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone withdraw@@ s Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his desk , eating and remin@@ ding citizens &apos; rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the hind@@ ran@@ ce is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf uses a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sk@@ ate street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ st &quot; logo from GDR times , or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ makers pose as rock energies , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; the stack@@ ed barrels of oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three bo@@ atmen - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; ess Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier , mis@@ lead a corp@@ se into the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ esen Hagen which surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when Siegfried sm@@ iles .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it . &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with a powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are ha@@ unted by a stor@@ my way . he hum@@ bles himself and bends his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat back in casual leisure time . &quot;
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly awaited .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to let go of a g@@ ellen@@ istic pipe concert in 2013 , and five years later , there were great jubil@@ ations in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went underground . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is looking forward to this .
&quot; one real@@ ises that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown into an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max lot works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in stone belt at the furniture fair , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture @-@ bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open all day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that happen ?
amount : I have taken S@@ LC .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked , what are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where to do his FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .

Pear@@ son cuts further 3.000 workplaces and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job reductions , which the general director John Fall@@ on announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where already 4,000 jobs were lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction programme to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had expressed its participation in pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after the first half of the year achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the Afghan capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say civil servants . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , distributed a statement by NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ Arab neighbourhood . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement , the explosion on Thursday evening was to take place when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and will be treated in the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram Air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide @-@ car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after col@@ la@@ ges
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay Obama &apos;s government regulation , repe@@ ating that States are oblig@@ ated to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday that it decided to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it showed the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and because we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed law@@ suit on Tuesday and said the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature reserves to worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , may reduce lung function and improve respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
community wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els resol@@ ves the establishment of a community space in the future residential complex . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will take some time before the church community so far is owned by the church , there is no longer any planning permission for the project to be stem@@ med by a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common room . &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the congregation .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council , such a communal space , is not to be seen as a meeting place for the residents of the living in the sen@@ i@@ ores , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , is determined by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a community space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of the total funding . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolutions stipul@@ ate that in this respect , there will be no stick between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is based on the environmental construction - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the lifting height and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this additive . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one can &apos;t move in such a way that one is now lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the community room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no supplement , but I get a real exchange value which is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s proposal to split the resolution accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; if we make the decision so , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : cycl@@ ist is sk@@ id@@ ded on the road
&quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist died on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath by a car and was severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was traveling by 12 : 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg , coming from Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
&quot; a passenger car driver , driving in the same direction , granted him priority . &quot;
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that ran a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern München must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with staff , the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot;
seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the staff at the German Football Record Champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 hrs / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at cups Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ren@@ ounce the BV@@ B with the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans under their spell .
&quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
the association Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
there is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; comes to meet the need for information for many har@@ z@@ ers .
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ss and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the panels should be complemented by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the star path train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the observer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the society explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star sh@@ one more than another , although it is much farther away . &quot;
&quot; also in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when it is best to be seen . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the Federal Office of Natural Protection , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star value - the planet route since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the de@@ mot@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to needs about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march to the next fix@@ ture would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko are meeting for the first time and discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light weight champion , went down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super fe@@ ather weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former heav@@ y@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he must move on light weigh@@ ted &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand this .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also showed interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title campaign in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans were asking for it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks he &apos;s &quot; &quot; River@@ side Champion &quot; &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injuries to tire bur@@ ners
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured person by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation in Au@@ e points will be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the first win of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result as well , were there not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is also to be optimized further . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a release , the For@@ tun@@ s don &apos;t want to catch any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better after the experience in preparation with the triple @-@ chain than with the qu@@ at@@ et chain .
&quot; even though I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just been able to build on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko found@@ el@@ mann , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we do not make so many mis@@ sp@@ elling mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann too goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak of a mis@@ guided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , believing that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favourite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at present , &quot; says the Interior Minister of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are the easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , just because we have the right to go under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which has to be hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Princip@@ al coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience its players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age application tests published
&quot; the latest results of trials for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily imply that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results , she noticed that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age assessment , in the X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this figure is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs fine , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Civil Engineering and Transport in the Government Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule will be met .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red sandstone .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge .
&quot; this is a margin fixation , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable connected to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project by means of hand@@ outs prior to the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard building and the collecting station in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge re@@ unions is 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together what else is difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the power day volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle of R@@ ond@@ ell invites for a &quot; big campaign kick @-@ off . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel stays colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking beneath the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ ger@@ German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , which shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how has the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel reports that he tried for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was initially in demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a refusal because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirche there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to keep their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it &apos;s time to clear up after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can draw back - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a goodbye with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the row Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ mari@@ ert tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; Pet@@ kov Sol@@ oth@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both combines the desire to not only exceed the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , combines classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally deals bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I fell in love with everyone whom I had learned . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; she especially suffered under &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but at school time , when she rather dressed like a boy , &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; . &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to get yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me und@@ am@@ aged , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor .
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who were caught in competitions with gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do all possible to ensure the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the rotten system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships starting on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a rein@@ statement . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still working free , he said in London after a lecture by the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers cut off in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the North Hessen town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed by a helicopter crash in Mali have thought . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; on the un@@ explained crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she called the two up@@ side drivers , but as the &quot; cor@@ onation of their subject . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
&quot; their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany , accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ mer Dom Saint Peter on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; roses laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and en@@ gros@@ sed in sat@@ anic . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built up the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six educated tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
there is no doubt about the UN mission in Mali by the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but it is also of high importance for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de Dom@@ kirche . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and continued in the message . &quot;
where Prinz Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and took the title &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; the native of Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) res@@ ig@@ ns for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
he said on Friday for the dissolution of parliament .
&quot; before that , the surprising exit of a Green Party from its parliament fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official election date , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to take it up .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relation was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it imperative that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Minister @-@ President withdraw@@ s confidence and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be legally examined , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally examined . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but somewhat strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens requested the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their country meeting .
&quot; we of course assume that she will return her country mandate , which she received from the Green Regional List , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the State Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests tremend@@ ously . &quot;
she has deliberately chosen not to speak any pron@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests from Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only the betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the head of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of the west costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian in her latest vanity and fru@@ stration of her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ate and tries to make political capital out of it .
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to embrace El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time in front of the SPD most powerful force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es Mr Schmidt ?
Germany is deb@@ ating about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal go ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ foodstuffs war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we currently know is a health hazard virtually impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been un@@ locked immediately and since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; as well as the makers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if the residual content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , they are non @-@ transfer@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the present state of knowledge , the production operations do not meet any immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damages because of suspected illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the case of serious diar@@ rhe@@ a . &quot;
is there only a lack of personnel or the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such occur@@ ren@@ ces and the surrender to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ arms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the company , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
in principle it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food delivery animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the facts will be promptly and completely clari@@ fied . &quot;
how the Financial Rules of Football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious champi@@ ons league tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler family of Qatar .
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to deal with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , which had enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reporting period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini fell from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the bill on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise average 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to outs@@ m@@ art their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not qualify as a legitimate income . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsorship from the Qatar Tourism Authority was infl@@ ated .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come across payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar W@@ WM will be ambass@@ adors and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could easily be found .
&quot; previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , making any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory meetings with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer , announ@@ cing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they discussed the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not entitled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the agreement .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the overall landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country owns an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new j@@ og@@ ger supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate . &quot;
now the sweet collaboration is in front of a possible end : the airline ren@@ oun@@ ces the contract .
&quot; on request of the news agency , Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white , red @-@ white chocolate bars spread to 14 grams a year before landing on passengers . &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; according to industry insi@@ der estimates of the order volume according to &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but even more important is the advertising effect : for a shot manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the number of applicants at the new tender .
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was unable to reach a position . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , chocolate bars distribute the Swiss on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; prior to signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works together with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates .
&quot; for long haul flights , the first class customers will be spoiled with goo@@ dies from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both business and economy class . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is simultaneously nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge period , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd were going to larger things . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like time is short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for an appealing tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow - they nevertheless managed to gain the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at one point a character clas@@ hes through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious co@@ op ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ one of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random del@@ u@@ sions that could heat this fran@@ chise as a way of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches that which I would consider as its logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with Rh@@ ys Thomas , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lica , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &quot; Fin@@ de the voice . &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the ver@@ acity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often happens like a single one .
&quot; it takes six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ acted to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are repeatedly visiting the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything for food for a success .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and were issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials also secured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the case of ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects of Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
&quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised crime crimes , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the presence of organised drug trafficking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the great use on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; according to the study , Italian nation@@ als were particularly interested in referring to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the ban@@ de &apos;s account . &quot;
way of compla@@ ining big gaps in the foreigners @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners @-@ register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly serious wrong decisions on asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the regional register of foreigners . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; partly serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in a manner similar to the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false ordin@@ ances , however , led to &quot; a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate commodities , &quot; i.e. , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this is what emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; therefore , the paper says that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF is guiding those procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except babies and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees arriving at first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , the state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot;
&quot; the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare for the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in total 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot;
&quot; at least among the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multip@@ licity of willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our bodies are laid out for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , not self @-@ serving , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions performed in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ table leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the Theatre House has led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ rel were one of the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 high blood donations each . &quot;
&quot; half as many awards Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pil@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave up ten times a 500 milli@@ liter of their juice . &quot;
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it with@@ held interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the budget income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
but it sign@@ aled that interest increases would be needed over the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that bor@@ rowing costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic package that was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February , although it is said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; at interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would require a certain tigh@@ tening of inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank however stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forecast for this and next year &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year represent 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound was dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to make no changes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest in interest and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the preceding three months has risen to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in salary , as the tigh@@ tening becomes worse first before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; in@@ comes from income in the coming years , but added that wages will be &quot; clear &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the fund .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed budgets , with three polic@@ y@@ makers calling for an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that exceeding its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders want to look sil@@ ently for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS UK announced that a pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being supplied by health care via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive acquisition .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale targeted , recorded and implemented . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed specifically at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England in order to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Mr Ian Green , President of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will help us to get closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ igned from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne said . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works are rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it seem longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars from Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering was going inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push the door up , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not fall into the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important but they don &apos;t play with your heart .
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million dollar property empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate about one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and designer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family of West@@ co founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - Paul referred to as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul about a third . &quot;
a court case states that this means Col@@ in owned property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an initial Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but rather raises Paul , to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk @-@ bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an shop of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis corporate group , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million . &quot;
&quot; Luke and Mark were both Luke and Mark , so Paul says on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in held back very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother . &quot;

Turkey &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more even course . &quot;
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others tried to t@@ ame tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; said the former election agent Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s Twitter habits under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s Twitter habits were ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
&quot; if his co @-@ workers manage to keep away from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has been able to consistently prevent Tru@@ mp controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp materials that may be condu@@ ci@@ ve to their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co , dealing entirely with this history , reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; recent and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone was malicious to announce a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp was reading the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , to receive the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked to pray and hope . &quot;
the police across Europe will send post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and requested . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday about the action , followed by the Winter &quot; &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; advent calendar . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many cur@@ ri@@ sts were hiding at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for post @-@ break@@ ers from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ rov has been viewed for more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online celeb@@ ri@@ ties have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them on the basis of references to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; row
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the foot of the war that have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ row . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are back again . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be named said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the countryside beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the Police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible get anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
&quot; from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof thanks to the former Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also income by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a gathering place for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the detention of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Council of the Council .
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt Object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building damage containers in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly removed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; nice citizen @-@ close &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a high level of downtown , Sch@@ erer stresses . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread widely , Sch@@ erer explains . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the noti@@ ons of the city are the same as those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in the courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the public from the restaurant . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special medi@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investigations and intensified his investigations .
&quot; CN@@ N reported , there are already the initial charges of the Gre@@ y@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interfer@@ ing specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand , who acted as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s in a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tru@@ mp was personally involved in bringing the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly have ham@@ pered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check present evidence in possible break@@ through@@ s and decide whether to raise charges .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called indic@@ t@@ ments .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on if they are bigger and controversial . &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Board can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to take part under oath .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ caster they have already issued inv@@ itations that revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; in the report , people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his partner Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also joined the discussion . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller did not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work , and that if necessary , he should act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the accus@@ ation of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the subject gives the democr@@ ats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else about which they can talk about .
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he knew nothing of the setting up of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but I usually work in secret , he said . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any measures that ha@@ sten the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he was not determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the Declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tru@@ mp had fired Com@@ ey .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June , in front of a Senate committee , tru@@ mp asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special agent and his collabor@@ ators . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be fired .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on ad@@ versaries of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented law@@ suits on Thursday that the special medi@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has detached from the Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us of the scar@@ cely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin . &quot;
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , which is heavy over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton@@ ne and weighs 5@@ 800 square kilometres , will now move to the north and will probably need two , three years , until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people does not eman@@ ate from him .
&quot; as far as climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg , research data is not clear . &quot;
&quot; but overall , for some 30 years , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream cones in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us .
Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say , that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is in danger , as the front edge never with@@ drew as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not raise sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it yields after melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in small measure , the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI estimates , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth @-@ largest shelf of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with nearly 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us will grow again or go back in the long term , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers do not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been crum@@ bling over the past decades . &quot;
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decrease in temperature .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ ame it to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to have Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employer &apos;s association in order to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ ta @-@ stag passed 41 new positions in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot;
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
currently there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann circuit .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought . &quot;
&quot; together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; wish of the parties &quot; , &quot; management shall develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside , pointing out concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who withdraw from the service due to illness or age . &quot;
so it &apos;s time to take action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völk@@ er- , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
he long ago made a big surprise for a big surprise when he questioned the personnel costs cap and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a suitable solution at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ related cities - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than the tari@@ ff for the public service actually envis@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least due to the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens tone on NGOs migrants &quot; boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor , Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot;
we can judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the &apos; Youth Save &apos; boat , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew receives infl@@ atable migrants , which are delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first of all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel prize winner organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants entering Italy after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ al@@ z , to enjoy Tri@@ als and Si@@ ghts for four days . &quot;
three befri@@ ended guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were long climbs for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , vantage point stood at the lookout spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in the last two days , many altitude metres have been announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ takes made welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at@@ m@@ ete sal@@ ine br@@ ine inhal@@ e in the open air .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group became acquainted with the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald of its best side - athle@@ tic and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - League set up for e @-@ sports
will the sports stars in future be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium during wind and weather ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ stri@@ ches included . &quot;
this is also the case with the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport division in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; There are still quite a few clubs to climb this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be more often present on these markets online more often than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sports computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA World Cup play on a competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , Li@@ fest@@ yles have long since become established in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asia games 2022 , E @-@ sports is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it really a kind of sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic has long dealt with the question .
&quot; e @-@ sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , because it is competitive and shows lots of biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid responsi@@ veness are needed . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise their body not only on the console , but also their body . &quot;
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ bers also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the highly integr@@ ative action of e @-@ sports .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sports .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey . &quot; &quot;
&quot; international , many countries are already on the move . &quot;
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport race off@@ erer Uni@@ cr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , according to D@@ utt , the soccer league clubs are now oblig@@ ated to set up an E @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ ves behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to exp@@ ire only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; D@@ utt says . &quot;
you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything remains the same with football as it was always .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced Con@@ rad Roy to suicide because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy which took life on 13 July 2014 .
the Roy &apos;s father said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards facing her eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she ended his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she did not show any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they totally regret .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not pray the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us to be there for His sisters , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she was &quot; &quot; prosec@@ uted &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit suicide to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text announcements that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote , &quot; You must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from any press of the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter in 2007 for murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; woman Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ly : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ater of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup , is no accident . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt there .
&quot; what was different on his place in the cabin , Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ly saw me immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but there was no Philipp L@@ ahm scored far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bayern @-@ Kapitän . &quot;
good that one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ i .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f who came from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants , and just from vacation . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed to those , to whom you have a lot of herbs that you want to keep in a mood . &quot;
&quot; so whoever was chosen to compete with the heritage of L@@ ahm , can use a little extra motivation only well . &quot;
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ cked as a mini @-@ lead over the field . &quot;
&quot; to the right at the back , that is its position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ i worked in this starting line like the one , who can take the helm as well . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to direct the un@@ recorded tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal helped to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches helped him to get out of the services of the Asia trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ cot were not negative . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran next to Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was very hard , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game build @-@ up . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result wasn &apos;t as we were hoping for .
but also he showed a good performance at the debut .
&quot; reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked at the game afterwards . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye to a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one . &quot;
Al@@ aba is motivated by Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believed in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter just before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Damen had wished all the best .
the Bayern @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ club of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our La@@ dies .
the twe@@ eter of the Austrian football team of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational injection .
the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el could also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ al@@ ese Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ d@@ ress@@ ings Tempo
&quot; it was often unfor@@ giving , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
nat@@ us sees the largest turn@@ around in infrastructure : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year the ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , until 2021 will be the building right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal road map . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ um correspon@@ dent Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) stri@@ ves , as suggested by Wis@@ ser , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports declining for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , &quot; says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master examination and 2500 euros , if graduates make their own self @-@ employed within ten years after the Master &apos;s training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , but at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; to date , 56 new engineers who want to recru@@ it mobility in the state run of mobility have only occupied 29 positions . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce claims to award more jobs to external offices .
&quot; commenting on the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf added more than 20 million euros less to the preservation of regional roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us is still expecting a country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only rated power supply in an I@@ HK rating with a rating of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
&quot; former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreement , she cleared the field again . &quot;
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support observ@@ ance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alizing exhaust f@@ umes driven by diesel vehicles also increases , which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indul@@ ging the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen mistakes , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; several of Volkswagen &apos;s employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the study could strain Volkswagen badly : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitor to join , a raft passes through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if it goes on Saturday again to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the construction paper wants to clarify .
&quot; on the raft , one sees a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent . &quot;
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish berg .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitor .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protected wild river . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los bul@@ b@@ ins and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon characters , the b@@ oll@@ ens of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still draws and works on a film . &quot;
his message : laugh@@ ing because there is too much suffering in the world .
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself among other things as a drawer for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo finds many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ l@@ ful figures still find a lot of distribution worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series for six years with his figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand perf@@ um@@ er than an opponent .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film are to be addressed to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from the Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions borne by dro@@ ught , the la@@ ven@@ der is decreasing because of the insects committed to dro@@ ught , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in the spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has an impact on the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ade , a micro bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holiday@@ makers but also for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dro@@ ught . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in Thurin@@ gia celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary this year .
strength highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
&quot; these days , Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ aries or a district court camp are to be experienced in the city centre . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after its death , and the re@@ porters will discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields since rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February , the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was to not comp@@ el Val@@ dez , following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , leaving the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he was active in 2003 as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he collabor@@ ated with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without b@@ umping into the drug drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in view of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ urs team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , always sitting at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you engage with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret starting and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells bad , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odor@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape constantly changes .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters were questioning whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers , whom the Gover@@ nor himself referred to as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it has been months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain scenery , where the drug gangs are de facto control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has focused on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the governor .
&quot; there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , carried out a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political planes almost the entire century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we &apos;d have known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; for his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was turned into a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which prot@@ ested against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees had become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez took a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is thei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and bringing them around because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked her to be re@@ structured by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his final book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media guard group Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern bor@@ der@@ land of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are ch@@ ased as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug trafficking is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer than at once all their phones began to hum@@ ming . &quot;
a number of gun@@ fights with riv@@ edge ri@@ vals and security forces near the resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell Emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the ker@@ b@@ stone edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ten near to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were frigh@@ tened at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; as you can only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible squ@@ ash of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the st@@ amped ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his amaz@@ ingly well @-@ preserved condition has intrigu@@ ed researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock out of place , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have discovered that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , even though it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ defence , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed us to better interfere in its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea bed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved ch@@ apped skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time , as giant mon@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived for millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton@@ ne heavy monster . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the st@@ owed ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 inches long tips that ra@@ ced from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater was sw@@ elled through western Canada , until a flooded river floo@@ ding into the open ocean . &quot;
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the hood always covers b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lotto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin cover still the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right front foot is at his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales in his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first police data , around 5 p.m. between the connections of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other . &quot;
&quot; at first , there was no information about the exact number of injured layers . &quot;
&quot; it was a light to moderate injury , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot;
a large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich a round of ten kilometres long was formed .
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ travel to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire department noted the characteristics of the car drivers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing to be seen sitting on the train and sleeping .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ering .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon past .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
one simply confirms by means of a mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ables the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the name of the train ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : a smartphone or tablet is needed . &quot;
and you must have booked an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
&quot; you also have to buy it through the app of the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button will then be added to the electronic de@@ valuation . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspec@@ tor seat Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passenger . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train service personnel , simply check yourself in the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &apos;s Marketing Manager . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; often you have , in any case , not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of one &apos;s ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other issues . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this only applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the one in St. Louis geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , which she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her mobile phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people who cried , and from a man claiming to be Brow@@ ns father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his gun and cried : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt sha@@ kes .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and of protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that she had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be educated in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said , notic@@ ing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , concentrating on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it all came . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document , or do you try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ jo@@ t occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that the movement was &quot; not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ more Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at Fer@@ rel@@ l because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook her energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras have long disappeared in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , even though it has not been built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been spl@@ itting the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the issue hardly leaves one . &quot;
&quot; on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , the other shops also benefit from the fact that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the property in which the farmer &apos;s market stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be finished . &quot;
&quot; the gallery mo@@ vers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ place , with the possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Sim@@ one room : &quot; we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost weekly for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women again and again very gladly . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also . &quot;
the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is especially interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
&quot; this is likely not to be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of them in our city .
&quot; you can see , however , how many shops are empty here - some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are offered fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall be built during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives .
or does the ghost bit gallery manage to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg before ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; that won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg are no longer a place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the premise of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being classified as a secret diplom@@ at about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ atlan@@ tic and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward , but had spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the E@@ spi@@ onage Act , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ler and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal stories that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Over@@ seas would turn judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition . &quot;
&quot; indeed , only a few days after the book was published , that Mann@@ ing would release Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome sort of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there are also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government warehouse and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to resolve the rigid divisions that he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed schol@@ arly en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological respect , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic book . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , how she appears with a hands @-@ free speech in the hands of the United States discipline of discipline like King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they talk about your words , they have won , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; so , never put the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , who are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stal@@ ks . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the place of events and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said civil servants . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ es , Vice President for University Relation@@ ships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
War@@ ren is senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them reinforce , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA driving plan was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not have anything to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian law approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office , at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has preferred to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli reported that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be deployed again . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people out from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer specialist groups and demo@@ graphics , and in some cases allow W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ de why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next one involved in sc@@ and@@ als ever since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the financial technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send custom &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair work . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , managing the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty clothes online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups .
&quot; in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their workplaces than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is part of their voices and that the work you are doing is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company succeed , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and deployment of employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you will have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
to take care of it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run it will lead to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose your business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s up to 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas .
some have pulled off their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes constitute a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players who are enrolled in summer courses will return to their final exam after the three @-@ hour exercise , before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center at 6 : 30 am next morning . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ to @-@ trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ges moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are expected to do 18 exercises in August . 20 before the beginning of the formal play preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the regulation change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multi @-@ employed Rou@@ tes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ ack@@ ed on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kins Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been cleared with foot balls , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; br@@ in players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fak@@ ers , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ er being flooded with false stories in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks , if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ y post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ tual review by third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes in its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot;

&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ tie Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980s . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat at the Ver@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now a inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England stretches the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , British May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb@@ nail on the page of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters continually smell smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting &quot; ) this all seems too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 when the last heir to Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who had something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l depic@@ ts his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok again and again and spend money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ ld@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to cope with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
&quot; with the closure of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep their logo and slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign to give a party on the Isle of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , they write on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that it is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Honne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to action , more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount will cost the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of people . &quot;
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; while Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , Chief of Staff , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the I@@ nex@@ il pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved in the attempted coup attempt , Ankara has been acting in Ankara since that week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the attempt to overthrow the coup as &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; , &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to completely clean the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really get a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the ban on female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the great job in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan fired more 7@@ 3@@ 95 national ministers by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country before .
three times they put@@ tied their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving pur@@ pos@@ efully an Islam@@ ization of the Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in just a few years . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , such a development could not let Nato become cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the Alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capacities are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; it fores@@ ees lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to renov@@ ate circuit for race shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the mar@@ bles track on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work will begin this year , according to the ministry of transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the circuit Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country ad@@ mits to this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; explained District Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost for the repair of the track was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered also in future by the country , is currently finally agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a railway link popular especially for tourists between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in recent months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the track is used by many people to order it again in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is very narrow in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , an Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to begin to take her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people are funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a st@@ eppe @-@ woman more progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion featuring pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed upon conversation or it can &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ usion to rape , when one goes a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bs one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compared to a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
but what perme@@ ates out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly sophisticated sex robots are emerging in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who pra@@ y@@ red women to have sexual assault . &quot;
&quot; the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ graphic proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ly that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tru@@ mp big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of dec@@ eit@@ ful relatives . &quot;
we are all ost@@ ensi@@ bly strict to let our filter bubbles burst .
&quot; less noticed , the power of trump@@ s to bring together families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a le@@ ft@@ ward poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity may have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely stran@@ gely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but in a further context it seems to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resul@@ t@@ ant action of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that one day will no longer rep@@ el us . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % In@@ come Tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp are in fact one of very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals turn to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ friendly music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can walk on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gru@@ es@@ ome while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts at his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he suffered from the prison authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;
&quot; on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death belt . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of St Valent@@ ine in 2013 by firing several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a curious egg
&quot; as the last of the &quot; &quot; Blum@@ berger schools &quot; , &quot; the four@@ thous@@ es from F@@ ark@@ ers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental Bürger@@ haus in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der elected a young Eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; Der Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken from him was sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes presented three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ dd@@ les , who wore cylinders to bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , said school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ quarter @-@ money chan@@ ger that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who is always jumping again and again , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cooking time is over now , explained the class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , they only leave school very reluct@@ antly because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they were able to rely on the four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@ four @-@
&quot; at the end , all students were able to hear a song from summer time and holiday season . &quot;
great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ year @-@ olds have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camping people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation was underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
the aim is to improve the emission characteristics of Euro 5 emissions and partially Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ a from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action obligatory ?
no . the software updates dealt with are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates are valid only for the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet a precise date . &quot;
Daimler informed us to address any person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the scope of the inspection . &quot;
how long should the change@@ over be carried out altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ a . &quot;
the slopes depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the autom@@ akers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE tells us to wait .
&quot; presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , as S@@ met@@ a . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
&quot; so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot;
the ace advises to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be delivered at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and will participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;

we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re in R@@ ente next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out - however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a city builder . &quot;
and the work still gives him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that await his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application has been fulfilled until now . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - taking into consideration the regular periods of notice - is still enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ authority for the administrative community , the applicant has to submit corresponding agreements . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for their advice . &quot;
&quot; but citizen proximity is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker who reports from a good working climate and good mood among the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , a number of important projects have gathered , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the construction department and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; for a city builder , there is a lot of room for design . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and garden shed , it is possible to react flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city construction master emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister also holds a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything is running over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of employee : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , says W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
who would like to bury Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of civil engineering and planning law .
&quot; civil engineering , civil engineering , civil engineering matters , administration of urban properties , municipal yard with building yard and municipal gar@@ dener as well as the Unter@@ e Bau@@ haus authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bike thrown on lines : South railway line closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , a wheel@@ er and bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond the borders of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay and the costs for rail replacement traffic , also sponsors of the railway customers could come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , there was a &quot; significant &quot; sum to go out , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South railway line could be managed without any obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people had dropped off Friday morning , two of them watched the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they were delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 meter of overhead lines had to be exchanged . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
&quot; meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the UK , causes ga@@ stri@@ c fights and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while people are usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found to detect a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet more tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han cause a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el loss if the same system also occurs in humans . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was however separated , had not . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ scopy of mice had to be done - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six bacterial species were found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how bacteria were interfer@@ ing with the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells like mice , and that most of us are reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is likely something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the opening of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho shaped his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was still wishing for three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , that are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new set@@ back for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns away : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister , before elections , always looked at Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party headquarters , but no tail@@ wind from the Bund , was the most important wish of the electoral warri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot;
there were downs .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be able to reliably rule , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; the Green @-@ German Managing Director , Michael Kell@@ ner , has called upon the stub@@ born Dutch Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return their mandate . &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and Ele@@ ction Leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true , &quot; an SPD leader si@@ ghs , when the new hi@@ de@@ bar message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , joins the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the un@@ expect@@ edly significant defeat of the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; this then became - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the do@@ ve , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ gh beat the party smoothly . &quot;
comrades in the weeks afterwards te@@ di@@ ous again .
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit from Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD deputy chief , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong with what one can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ gas @-@ aff@@ aires and its role in the supervisory board , the Minister @-@ President of Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised for a long time . &quot;
some survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation over the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades , therefore , try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the back@@ sli@@ dden parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests puts her own career fairs on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ ev@@ itz has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in parliament , the lower @-@ state parliament . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; wil@@ low four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Anglo @-@ Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the parliamentary election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local people III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in sensi@@ bilities . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back at what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been rehabilitation areas in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the development area II of 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is finally important to also promote interior development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the District Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are from the country , the rest from the community . &quot;
how is a rehabilitation area now ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; it also plays a role , however , whether there is interest in the planned area . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territorial borders could then be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge was represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the Con@@ federation Programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations were to be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the remedi@@ ation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the funding period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey will be carried out only once , within the framework of which the persons involved in the rehabilitation department get a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as soon as possible the decre@@ es are to take place , so that the restoration can begin in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each commune must carry out the said prec@@ urs@@ ors . &quot;
the aim is to assess the urban development of the city and to decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective plot , there will be a restructuring note in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ bility and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was an essential success factor for the project .
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; where it is concerned , among other things , the structural condition and the restructuring views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and housing arch &quot; , &quot; information about the size , layout and habit@@ ations of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out when the premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to note , that Got@@ tw@@ ald pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for grants . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of the subsidies in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first grin@@ ds first .
&quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one now has installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the White House advertising costs will cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month , tax@@ pa@@ yers will cost up to $ 24@@ ,000 in accordance with the military supplied to the TI@@ ME magazine . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire truck made from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ klift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the helicopter was built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , the Deputy Marine commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that on July 17 , at 7@@ am the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security guards remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp carried out an investigation as the president &apos;s aircraft powered from the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , Taxi Services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 practice sessions . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
Si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary terms for the pres@@ idency , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of unit list the flight time of the plane more than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for re@@ funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement resolutions for Do@@ D not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former president of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter &apos;s use for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to Si@@ kor@@ sky representatives and her@@ ded with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga joins the Table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the Table 3rd Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite five games of still flaw@@ less balance , the top runner of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga was rewarded with the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
&quot; on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the far north are concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to w@@ agers in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , with views of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ se@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult for us as always . &quot;
&quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , which is currently active at the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella , does not compete for the Bundes@@ liga . Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el yesterday with the White Cloud An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
&quot; he should also be present in Kiel , like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also come back to the team . &quot;
&quot; for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World R@@ ank@@ ings in January 2016 , one does not fill the cad@@ re from the coach staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp wasn &apos;t really happy when he put his signature under the law on Wednesday evening under the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , Congress contained a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the native O@@ MV are wor@@ rying , who co @-@ financed with other European companies the construction of the Russian East Soul North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; looked at what the group could defend , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the Hit@@ series from Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the season three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites US and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
R@@ ole backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ work itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on the 1st of September , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked in addition to the house , a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and provides fresh ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates 46 children &apos;s day @-@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are looked after at least 45 hours of a week , eat lunch in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from September 1st : they heat up the delivered food , add them to salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een units - decide over the course of the hour .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; comments Pom@@ mer@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaningful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ging of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , has also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical way , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are reset . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ía says . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , &quot; &quot; A strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men are trying to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police , the men of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old spoke to friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to use the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , but this was ab@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; without a prey , the duo fled . &quot;
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s factory in Glasgow
&quot; for managers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union would like to make sure that they have long @-@ term commitment to production at their Glasgow facility . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investments in the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant that next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea C@@ oo@@ dies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; first experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; concerns &quot; that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned by our members . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; hence , under the perspective of workplaces , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross won a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies , operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations are changing at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may interest its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ um@@ b after having submitted an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach heated the transfer window in the summer , as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world been warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G President ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 attracted interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , it will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish Association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator intentionally revers@@ ed one in the royal fields street in front of the number 30 ordered sco@@ ot@@ ers , thus attacking the vehicle &apos;s disgu@@ ise of more than 200 Euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for clu@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an accident at the B 215 , between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police witnesses witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dge and tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um met his VW at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
&quot; in the area of the town of Stol@@ zen@@ au , he met a passenger car in his lane , so he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
property damage was created on the passenger car .
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now ask for witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the causing experience , to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au at tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report about the abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen takes care of discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after the publication of the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Cathedral Choir master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the events .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral scra@@ pe , &quot; double standards &quot; would be measured . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act &quot; that would be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was striking , as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ oured fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a very normal ped@@ ago@@ gical instrument &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse cases , also Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely un@@ ju@@ stly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the mem@@ o@@ irs &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could also be more intense . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , E@@ zek@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of non @-@ violence at the site of protection found in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) , is a contradictory picture of Cathedral Choir Champion Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has been hand@@ gri@@ eved when a dom@@ coil set no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you don &apos;t have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ever appears in it . &quot;
he is currently dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; you can at best repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or have not taken the first hint seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um on which it worked was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also depic@@ t him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who fed the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high level of emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and cast the keys on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ cow@@ ards and drew too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he already gave himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period of the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you know such methods of breeding as well ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , the terrible sexual abuse and the ex@@ tor@@ tion of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is true of dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; you wonder if it doesn &apos;t have to do with his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed to him . &quot;
many who have never understood him are still busy at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in all respects !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot has been reported on the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be charged in the final report any involvement or co @-@ worker with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted in the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a person of concern for the others , &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who was professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; in terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben are more urgent or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear conclusion : &quot; that in the run @-@ up affected students and / or their environment entrusted him , could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of all knowledge . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these atro@@ cious crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was much to read about &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of having &quot; gaz@@ ing out &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , other vor@@ ti@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral scra@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were victi@@ mi@@ zed and portrayed , and suffered terri@@ bly , all acquired at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most of the witnesses put emphasis on , the subject of &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ ic &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the accus@@ ation still remains . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 . &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently closed the ears ahead of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , in the pre @-@ school , he will continue to practice the test penalty . &quot;
&quot; even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties in Bavaria had long been banned . &quot;
&quot; before that , it took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably still knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected could perhaps exagger@@ ate or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been crossed . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he always had looked at it . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in the year 1980 the test penalty in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply the present ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time , too . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past according to present @-@ day moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was ab@@ hor@@ rent and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond the then practice . &quot;
this is all horrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is to draw ear@@ nest and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of its Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played with you in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject matter test also go to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , re@@ counts from his perspective , as the cathedral scra@@ pers played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t mean by no means that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but this too must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , you don &apos;t even make a big vo@@ cal@@ ist and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , deep @-@ loving , deeply believing and sav@@ our@@ y people , from whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with him , like many former cathedral scra@@ pers still today , 23 years after his accreditation , regularly contact him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the cathedral scra@@ pers are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they almost honour . &quot;
&quot; and , please , once again clearly : all that one repro@@ aches upon him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the stand , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
