<seg id="2">An Irish institution where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a Gruftkapelle, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that already had to rain because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the Bayern-Atlases, an offer by Geoportas Bavaria to the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very informative."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large overview map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called" "primitive" "papers."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria, of course for military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops finally ended up with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying department."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional Sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is the sendling which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the consignment was used 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, sendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered straps from the so-called" "primitive" "from which the land tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots are no longer farmers there today - but farmers of the" "Land in the Sun" "plant."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the field of the current district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "at the Gasteig" "or from the height" "On the air" "- but also in big letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 there was the Munich-based district Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to employ force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular pension in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrist."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Salesianum in Munich on the grounds of the former prison institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV München East, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "- based on the original construction of the asylum-institution, was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as the" main square "in 1856, the" Kaufingerstraße "was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farthing Promotion has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-american travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based occurrences occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the Group's statement. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state enforcement agencies that disproportionately aim for minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during his journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General in which it is shown that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than the White House.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">"people have to be ready, whether it is buying money or letting the relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report Programme of the FBI, which classify the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations, which according to the ACLU will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholder groups have used the measure to respond to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidewizard project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the Landgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives from the CDU town hall met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest milk "is the alternative marketing route for the milk of its cows, as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is exclusively regionals.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the chairman of Fischbach, he described the fence project as" elementary importance. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot manage profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green areas care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct a bioeconomy."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the forestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how to continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers stand for the promotion oftentimes in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"thus, the area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs of the total cost of €71 500 were promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture-fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and land women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiss also stood firm:" "here, best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art funding of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveyed material labelled by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fencing surface must not be feasible (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"the application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fisherman Weidezhen project in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the area of disclosure is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the most carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller was not attacking the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty itators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he assumed their significance, and in particular the significance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to address a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, and the miserable rubbish of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable apostasy" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">"this conflict, because of the significance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America."</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out image.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus was changing the significance of the statue, the people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the world around:" Lady Liberty moves ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch will not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch will not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship title will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that kicks off on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" something special has been developed in Scotland, "and the United Kingdom's athletics has to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butovo - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to team captain by the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh made quite natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman that one should watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved with the medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates have voted for me and have chosen me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb up to Podien."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the burgeoning of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he complained in criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we will be led like sheep for slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is astonishingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with its voters and to debate his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blocking of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is designated as official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md. she was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely comment that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news show "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the governor referred to as" "concentrated Spam-attack" "would probably call others" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical morals or to arrest demonstrators and to silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers appeared between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers fell on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">"and even then, Washington had anonymous trolls."</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain were overwhelmed by his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) came to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking in 167," said Heko Becher. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994."</seg>

<seg id="251">"after half an hour the soldered tuber is taken with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed up."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp."</seg>

<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was included in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement that stirred up independence against the Dutch rule quickly appealed against the Jakarta government, which maintains the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it."</seg>

<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, living in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>

<seg id="349">"some of the top leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of" securing national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is also out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain the majority of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>

<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelper Kine, the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development was not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unquiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacifist states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate" various and widespread violations "in Papua (including the Paniai-shooting)."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically been supporting the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta:" "in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases."</seg>

<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the Human Rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, natives broke their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source, who also participated in the session, but remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia will have another presidential election 2019, but the US will probably not vote for Jokowi again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the paniai shots," says Gobi, Chairman of the tribal Council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" guilt "he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shotgun made a final symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of an victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that perhaps they will never come to justice, but at least they do not allow those responsible to forget their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever-triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed yet another, less glittering number for the first time: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition has just started."</seg>
<seg id="425">"now Musk clears: from the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his former position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a time limit on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for soil near ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan, and to avoid interfering with local choices or obstructing economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time."</seg>

<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prusion regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tumblers to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. HilariusChapel was first mentioned in documents in the" "Württembergische Urgent" ": count Hermann von Sulz sold" "the mountain with the parish church to Tumour including the Vogtei" "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document according to the document, in addition to the former parish church, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamt of Freudenstadt of 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the" mountain "is the third, the village's glorious nucleus."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 will underpin these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The privilege of patronage originated from the early medieval self-church right.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, refunded and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was fragile at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded in 1692 for the first time, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were smashed and the bell parts were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops camped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">They pulled out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the cemetery of the Tumour Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead of hearing-silence.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm collapsed and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the Turmzwerg still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem as successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility as successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery in St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"Hartmut Romann, the local leader, speaks the final word."</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to finish the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>

<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal requirement for the construction, and has therefore turned to the Councillor. "</seg>
<seg id="506">The Boisheim association has called on Council Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It would be illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal has existed a wind power concentration zone."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">"such zones should prevent" "sparing" "the landscape."</seg>
<seg id="511">"although a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to use a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette, but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a lack of form."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the granted permission is still illegal and therefore also to take back," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council has again decided to take the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "this is where the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter has been entered into the circle of Viersen since last week," "declared a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle asks them to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, it is not expected that the procedure will be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday didn't want to express itself to the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large grounds."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this is roughly one-fifth of the electricity requirement of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re hopes to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="687">"it is a nice, wide spectrum that I see here."</seg>
<seg id="688">"I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults."</seg>
<seg id="689">"they are now 26 years, so a late-working volunteer."</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that happen?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I have taken SLC.</seg>
<seg id="692">"and then a civil engineer, let's say, successfully broken off."</seg>
<seg id="693">"I know for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else, working with people."</seg>
<seg id="694">"and then I asked, what are you doing?"</seg>
<seg id="695">"do a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, perhaps also, really."</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I have collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">"I will study dual, probably do a social worker training in Jugendamt Herne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm."</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">"quantity: yes, it is very variable."</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends on where to do his FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It is possible to make it from the people's home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">"I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon support."</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was exactly the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works.</seg>
<seg id="708">Different from civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">"sure, here it's not about calculating statics."</seg>
<seg id="710">"you always have other people in front of you, each having a different story behind each other."</seg>
<seg id="711">"whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually."</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: I am not the type.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">"lots of love, lots of kindness."</seg>
<seg id="717">"there are also negative moments, but that's how life is."</seg>

<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.</seg>
<seg id="728">"on Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul."</seg>
<seg id="729">"in a NATO statement, the explosion on Thursday evening was to take place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and will be treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram Airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">"correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram."</seg>

<seg id="739">"the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay Obama's government regulation, repeating that States are obligated to curb the smog-causing emissions. this took place a day after 15 states sued the agency because of the step."</seg>
<seg id="740">"the EPA announced late on Wednesday that it decided to advance the so-called" "ozone provisions 2015", "and said it showed the agency's obligation to cooperate with states."</seg>
<seg id="741">"we believe in dialogue with and because we react to our state partners," "said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in an explanation."</seg>
<seg id="742">"Pruitt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the ozone regulations in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country, to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018."</seg>
<seg id="743">"a group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with Colombia's district, filed lawsuit on Tuesday and said the effort is illegal."</seg>
<seg id="744">"the government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, which according to Trump should boost economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="745">"however, efforts have caused the setbacks of the democrats and nature reserves to worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health."</seg>

<seg id="747">Community wants community space</seg>
<seg id="748">"in the end, the decision was clear: with two counterparts, the municipal council of Fluorn-Wintzels resolves the establishment of a community space in the future residential complex."</seg>
<seg id="749">"before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden."</seg>
<seg id="750">"although it will take some time before the church community so far is owned by the church, there is no longer any planning permission for the project to be stemmed by a private investor."</seg>
<seg id="751">"for this, there is a discussion about a common room."</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council, such a communal space, is not to be seen as a meeting place for the residents of the living in the seniores, but openly in the church."</seg>
<seg id="755">"as an example, the word" "knitting café" "made the lap."</seg>
<seg id="756">"the decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, is determined by funding opportunities."</seg>
<seg id="757">The construction is in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">"the establishment of a community space would be, as reported by Tjaden, with 60 percent of the total funding."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the proposed resolutions stipulate that in this respect, there will be no stick between the legs, stating that both saddle - which is based on the environmental construction - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the lifting height and the construction of economic power - would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="760">"needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer means this additive."</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: unanimously he passes the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It is not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"Daniela's reputation refers to the many own buildings, with which one can't move in such a way that one is now lean into the common room out of the window, she says:" "I'm doing hard with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger necessarily speaks for the community room - but absolutely against a municipal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface there is no supplement, but I get a real exchange value which is marketable in the case of doubt, is the counter speech."</seg>
<seg id="767">"Staiger's proposal to split the resolution accordingly, finds three proponents."</seg>
<seg id="768">"it remains with two counterparts in the original programme that Stefan Haller summarizes:" "if we make the decision so, we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="798">The association Observatory Sankt Andreasberg is planning this.</seg>
<seg id="799">There is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003.</seg>
<seg id="800">A "star path" comes to meet the need for information for many harzers.</seg>
<seg id="801">"he combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance."</seg>
<seg id="802">The members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.</seg>
<seg id="803">"in a first phase until 2018, the association plans" "well-accessible installations at five to six locations" "in Oberharz."</seg>
<seg id="804">"question: St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the panels should be complemented by internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"for this reason, a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing a location."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the star path train is to be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the star trail, the observer experiences a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the society explained. "</seg>
<seg id="810">"in addition, they learned why stars would have different colors, or why a star shone more than another, although it is much farther away."</seg>
<seg id="811">"also in which constellation is a selected star, and when it is best to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="812">"since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg the highest observatory in northern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="813">"according to information from the Federal Office of Natural Protection, the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="814">Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly.</seg>
<seg id="815">"since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned star value - the planet route since 2003."</seg>
<seg id="816">"starting from Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary Trail leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an" extraterrestrial "location in Diemarden (municipality Gleichen) with the planet Sedna."</seg>

<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.</seg>

<seg id="831">"I am a former heavyweight," Garcia reminded. "</seg>
<seg id="832">"I have ascended for bronze [to 140 pounds], but I am not so big."</seg>
<seg id="833">I'm small for 140.</seg>

<seg id="861">"after the 2: 2 season opener against Braunschweig, Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue points will be possible."</seg>
<seg id="862">"with the first win of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result as well, were there not the two opponents at 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out better in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three-chain is also to be optimized further."</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a gate after a release, the Fortuns don't want to catch any more."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better after the experience in preparation with the triple-chain than with the quatet chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"even though I don't know how to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have just been able to build on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko foundelmann," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are even better harmonising and we do not make so many misspelling mistakes in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann too goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can speak of a misguided start, you don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could be okay," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I judge the start into the season only after six to eight seasons," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season practically with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension favourite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know exactly where they are at present," says the Interior Minister of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland are the easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we take them away, just because we have the right to go under the first six, is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which has to be hit from the start," explains Fortunas Principal coach. "</seg>
<seg id="881">To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.</seg>
<seg id="882">So Funkel doesn't want to experience its players on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish asylum-age application tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">"the latest results of trials for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Department (Migrationsverket) has been criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged 18 or older while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion that the person was "possibly under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the figures are fairly constant," "he said to the magazine The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily imply that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases suggesting that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results, she noticed that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of the medical age assessment, in the X-ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usually through puberty."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," he said to the Metro. "</seg>
<seg id="901">"Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low. "</seg>
<seg id="902">"the biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case this figure is about 10 percent."</seg>
<seg id="903">Fully in the plan</seg>

<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">"both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long."</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge.</seg>
<seg id="918">"this is a margin fixation, which is also used as an operating path."</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge should be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should be gone.</seg>

<seg id="993">"world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised the Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in the sport."</seg>
<seg id="994">Russian athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight doping.</seg>
<seg id="995">"he said," "I'm sorry for" "all the athletes, who were caught in competitions with gold and silver medals."</seg>
<seg id="996">"despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had evidence of state-funded doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," "said IAAF-President Coe the reporter."</seg>
<seg id="998">The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do all possible to ensure the Federation is redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again," "said Coe."</seg>
<seg id="1001">We need to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.</seg>

<seg id="1092">"Mr Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?"</seg>
<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1094">"on the consumer protection portal www.foodstuffs warnung.de, the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs-charms."</seg>
<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">"even if, after all, what we currently know is a health hazard virtually impossible."</seg>
<seg id="1097">Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?</seg>
<seg id="1098">Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"nevertheless, my house has been unlocked immediately and since the announcement of the sadness of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries."</seg>

<seg id="1106">"according to the present state of knowledge, the production operations do not meet any immediate guilt."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious champions league tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial fair play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar writes and bring him to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to deal with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break the break-even point in their business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, which had enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP reporting period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini fell from the presidency in 2015, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the bill on the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise average 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies connected to the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not qualify as a legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come across payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 contested that Neymar WWM will be ambassadors and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily be found.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive, making any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory meetings with PSG over Neymar's transfer, announcing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They discussed the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>

<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed budgets, with three policymakers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>

<seg id="1292">"NHS UK announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being supplied by health care via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS UK boss Simon Stevens as an" important new intervention, "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>

<seg id="1296">Prepositional prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants are identified to agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is used in a large scale targeted, recorded and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>

<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England in order to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>

<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resigned from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne said. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelworks are rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it seem longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars from Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering was going inside," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight so that when you push the door up, it glides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not fall into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important but they don't play with your heart.</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and designer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the family of Westco founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - Paul referred to as" the main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's wealth and Paul about a third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means Colin owned property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in an initial Affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but rather raises Paul, to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the event with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Turkey's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more even course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that were to be persuaded," said the former election agent Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Ms. Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keeping Trumps's Twitter habits under control, according to six ex-election campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habits were ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his co-workers manage to keep away from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that may be conducive to their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico, dealing entirely with this history, reported in May about the preference of the advisors to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"recent and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone was malicious to announce a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to" be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter due to chicanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump was reading the article and started asking people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, to receive the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1444">"from Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise"</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1st March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof thanks to the former Ambiente operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also income by the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered as a gathering place for controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the detention of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Council of the Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a home of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>

<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later become" "nice citizen-close", "as Thomas Scherer is expressing."</seg>

<seg id="1468">"you don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high level of downtown, Scherer stresses."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to spread widely, Scherer explains."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city are the same as those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior installations are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. special mediator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury according to a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee has taken up the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller extended his investigations and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"CNN reported, there are already the initial charges of the Greyum in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand, who acted as consultants of the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took more and more Trumps in a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Special Investigator Trump was personally involved in bringing the accusation whether the president could possibly have hampered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check present evidence in possible breakthroughs and decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called indictments.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on if they are bigger and controversial."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to take part under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN broadcaster they have already issued invitations that revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">"in the report, people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his partner Paul Manafort also joined the discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the setting show that Mueller did not intimidate himself in his work, and that if necessary, he should act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the accusation of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the history of Russia is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the democrats a chance to feel good because they have nothing else about which they can talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he knew nothing of the setting up of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but I usually work in secret, he said."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any measures that hasten the work of the special agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he was not determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the Declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump were loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June, in front of a Senate committee, trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special agent and his collaborators."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller would be fired.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on adversaries of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented lawsuits on Thursday that the special mediator could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has detached from the Schelhagus of the scarcely seven-fold size of Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="1520">He shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, which is heavy over a trillion tonne and weighs 5800 square kilometres, will now move to the north and will probably need two, three years, until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people does not emanate from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"as far as climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg, research data is not clear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"but overall, for some 30 years, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cream cones in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhagus floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abrupt was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelhagus is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say, that also the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is in danger, as the front edge never withdrew as far as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not raise sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it yields after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in small measure, the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI estimates, the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth-largest shelf of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelhagus will grow again or go back in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have been crumbling over the past decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline has contributed to the decrease in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years and tame it to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside, pointing out concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">It sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a regular "competition of public employers."</seg>

<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a suitable solution at short notice, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co-operation with the county-related cities - should strive for a house tariff," "said peoples."</seg>

<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German Relief Organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organisation in a statement on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can judge all accusations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the 'Youth Save' boat, the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that its crew receives inflatable migrants, which are delivered directly from traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring" essential changes or disabilities "to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel prize winner organisation is Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti now said that the number of migrants entering Italy after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Biker, the" Berlin outpost "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz, to enjoy Trials and Sights for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three befriended guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were long climbs for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, vantage point stood at the lookout spot, connected by" flowered "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"in the last two days, many altitude metres have been announced."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and intakes made welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers atmete saline brine inhale in the open air.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group became acquainted with the Pfälzer Wald of its best side - athletic and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - League set up for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium during wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gastriches included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">This is also the case with the first Bundesligavereine who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport division in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "There are still quite a few clubs to climb this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where gamers from different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual soccer players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be more often present on these markets online more often than to send the Bundesliga to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sports computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or even the FIFA World Cup play on a competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sport, Lifestyles have long since become established in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and with the Asia games 2022, E-sports is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobatic has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"e-sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, because it is competitive and shows lots of biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness are needed."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise their body not only on the console, but also their body."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobbers also sees problems:" doping becomes more and more a topic. "</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform in online games and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the highly integrative action of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport" is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey. ""</seg>
<seg id="1646">"international, many countries are already on the move."</seg>
<seg id="1647">"big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport race offerer Unicrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot happening in Europe too.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobbers."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, according to Dutt, the soccer league clubs are now obligated to set up an E-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany laves behind," explains VfB Executive Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to expire only in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company with the modern market at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," Dutt says. "</seg>
<seg id="1656">You can't keep in mind that everything remains the same with football as it was always.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"poison eggs, egg alternatives for cooking and baking"</seg>
<seg id="1658">"in the meantime, almost all federal states have been affected by scandal over poisoned eggs."</seg>
<seg id="1659">Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all the eggs from the sale in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"in regiments, only eggs should be taken which demonstrably do not contain a fipronil."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter sentenced Conrad Roy to suicide because of the texts Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy which took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is not comforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downwards facing her eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She ended his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she took no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she did not show any regrets." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "awful circumstance that they totally regret.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find that their age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant effect on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day when I do not pray the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, despite all my pain, which we will carry for eternity with us to be there for His sisters," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was" "prosecuted" "that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or would be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit suicide to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carters revealed text announcements that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote," You must do it, Conrad "and" All you have to do is turn on the generator, and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from any press of the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter in 2007 for murder at her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">"woman Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison. "</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimberly: learning from the new Mini-Later of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that Joshua Kimi was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup, is no accident."</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern traut a big season to the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt there.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"what was different on his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimberly saw me immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but there was no Philipp Lahm scored far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the trainer has not announced it," "said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as a Bayern-Kapitän."</seg>
<seg id="1695">Good that one could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples.</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the coach could also suggest Kimi.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player in the C-Elf who came from youth players, debutants, and just from vacation."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"sugar is distributed to those, to whom you have a lot of herbs that you want to keep in a mood."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"so whoever was chosen to compete with the heritage of Lahm, can use a little extra motivation only well."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimi confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old flicked as a mini-lead over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"to the right at the back, that is its position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all Kimi worked in this starting line like the one, who can take the helm as well."</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions and tried to direct the unrecorded troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had a look for the whole, while many others were occupied with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal helped to replay his missing fitness (hardly); Renato Sanches helped him to get out of the services of the Asia trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle, in their first appearance in the Bayern-Tricot were not negative."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked very well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran next to Kimi, Rudy before the defense, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli-storm was very hard, and in addition, Süle tried a few times in the game build-up."</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy admitted that the result wasn't as we were hoping for.</seg>
<seg id="1711">But also he showed a good performance at the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"relocation, tempo change:" for this style I was also picked up. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as usual this Bavaria-world is still for the newcomers, one looked at the game afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Rudy, for example, did not have one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi said goodbye to a few crunchy statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard an interesting sentence from Süle:" "what is going on here, I already noticed."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"in Bavaria you just have to win every game." ""</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often unforgiving, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">"this is evident after more than a year, in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wisser (FDP) is in office."</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says:" "Wisser attacks the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">Natus sees the largest turnaround in infrastructure: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year the ministry is hoping for a planning procedure, until 2021 will be the building right."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country is also playing the Westumgehung Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal road map."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministerium correspondent Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees in it a signpost for supporting regional, but internationally competing companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (Chamber of Commerce) strives, as suggested by Wisser, in the wine a Rhineland-Palatinate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports declining for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">"the planned road construction is quick to create facts, but at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"to date, 56 new engineers who want to recruit mobility in the state run of mobility have only occupied 29 positions."</seg>

<seg id="1743">"commenting on the calculations of the Court of Auditors, CDU vice-president Christian Baldauf added more than 20 million euros less to the preservation of regional roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"in addition, Frank natus is still expecting a country's concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"furthermore, the current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"in 2016, regional companies had only rated power supply in an IHK rating with a rating of 3,4."</seg>

<seg id="1751">"one day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1752">"the BMW Group said the company believes that" there are smarter options than driving restrictions, "and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is resident - to ban or limit diesel vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have greatly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support observance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"but nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of car manufacturers, systems for neutralizing exhaust fumes driven by diesel vehicles also increases, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indulging the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen mistakes, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but return to normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"several of Volkswagen's employees were indicted in the United States, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1762">"the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italians and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States."</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"in the first years as an artist, he proposed himself among other things as a drawer for greeting cards - which frustrated him."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once. "</seg>
<seg id="1783">"after stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the" Stern "and other leading magazines around the world."</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo finds many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"again and again, the artist was inspired by cities."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"due to the conditions borne by drought, the lavender is decreasing because of the insects committed to drought, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in the spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicaade, a micro bacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers but also for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly paper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists will discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after its death, and the reporters will discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields since rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February, the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was to not compel Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, leaving the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he collaborated with five colleagues to establish Riodosice and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without bumping into the drug drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish hard-fitting studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in view of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodours team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse as a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret starting and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells bad, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodorce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape constantly changes.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters were questioning whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers, whom the Governor himself referred to as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain scenery, where the drug gangs are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has focused on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political planes almost the entire century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we'd have known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "for his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers, which protested against the killings of journalists, because the employees had become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on walking paths and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and bringing them around because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked her to be restructured by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his final book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media guard group Articulo 19 assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern borderland of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note signed by the Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslav Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are chased as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer than at once all their phones began to humming."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of gunfights with rivedge rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued escalating as promised by a series of Kartell Embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the kerbstone edge, they published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone."</seg>

<seg id="1917">Sirens heulten near to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were frightened at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces."</seg>

<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible squash of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something of an "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the stamped armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his amazingly well-preserved condition has intrigued researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something out of the surrounding rock out of place, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have discovered that this herbivorous, even though it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique known as a counter-defence, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed us to better interfere in its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs-carnivores must have been the chalk-time," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea bed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved chapped skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just shoot a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time, as giant monopods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tonne heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the stowed armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20 inches long tips that raced from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swelled through western Canada, until a flooded river flooding into the open ocean."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater coverage of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the hood always covers bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remnants of the skin cover still the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales in his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1977">"it was a light to moderate injury, a police spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing to be seen sitting on the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="1989">And then: buffering.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One simply confirms by means of a mobile phone that you take your seat and devaluables the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will be available on many other long-haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a railway speaker. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "is the name of the train ticket devaluation without Schaffner."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: a smartphone or tablet is needed."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you must have booked an online ticket - which already do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to buy it through the app of the train, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"for the" "comfort check-in" "works so: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket under" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button will then be added to the electronic devaluation."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train attendant arrives at the ticket inspector seat Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already devaluated online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" check-in "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passenger."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without ticketing through our train service personnel, simply check yourself in the DB Navigator itself."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr's Marketing Manager. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often drives train, knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"often you have, in any case, not all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of one's ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other issues."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people who cried, and from a man claiming to be Browns father, who wore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and cried:" "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shakes.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and of protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, came to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that she had many times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be educated in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noticing that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, concentrating on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all came. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell:" do you want to document, or do you try to find a story that you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todejot occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferr's's experience - to show that the movement was" not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of Whose Streets show?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr's's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife. "</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the dehumanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film" Blackmore Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "at Ferrell because of their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook her energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras have long disappeared in Ferguson, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it has not been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian precinct has been splitting the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the issue hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"on our Facebook page" Volksfreund Bitburg, "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a human "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, the other shops also benefit from the fact that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property in which the farmer's market stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery movers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-place, with the possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone room: "we have been buying in the farmer's market almost weekly for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women again and again very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also."</seg>
<seg id="2103">The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is especially interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this is likely not to be very low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"you can see, however, how many shops are empty here - some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are offered fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmer's market hall be built during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to expel all business from Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "that won't work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmers market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg are no longer a place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is broken down, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the premise of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being classified as a secret diplomat about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transatlantic and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born in Bradley Edward, but had spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butler and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">She could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal stories that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Overseas would turn judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"indeed, only a few days after the book was published, that Manning would release Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome sort of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there are also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government warehouse and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to resolve the rigid divisions that he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature among them (the" i "in their surname is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scholarly encyclopedia of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological respect, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, how she appears with a hands-free speech in the hands of the United States discipline of discipline like King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they talk about your words, they have won," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never put the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacons, who are like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human-hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford which are looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stalks."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the place of events and detectives investigate the engravings as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, said civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, she has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubes, Vice President for University Relationships, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem should now be in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of the Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the U.S. investigative authorities in every possible way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urges the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to localize them reinforce," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, which had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA driving plan was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">"the PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not have anything to concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything will be implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list is that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian law approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-funded doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales office, at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has preferred to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping control in Russia in November 2015."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli reported that RUSADA moved" in the right direction "in order to be deployed again."</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"and even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed. "</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people out from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer specialist groups and demographics, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the Snap polls and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ailments and which managers have low approval results - so that you can rebode why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next one involved in scandals ever since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start-ups like Glint, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the financial technical site Let's Talk Payments."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla."</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"like Glint, Convercent companies can send custom" pulse "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas."</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has seized the regulators," "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"in the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair work."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, managing the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes." ""</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"for this reason, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bruges moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scottie Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat at the Verl River Valley in Kent and is now a inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England stretches the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering iewicz, British May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumbnail on the page of a letter that was written by a double-agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters continually smell smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>

<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome-greeting") this all seems too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with land patrons, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 when the last heir to Elizabeth Hussey died."</seg>

<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps that represent who had something:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch fighting for the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all the way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an upheaval that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell depicts his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was dug out)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite crook again and again and spend money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell's men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a heap of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erwithin."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his deployment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique write experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Eläldmäki, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Inexil preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wire drawing of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people who have been involved in the attempted coup attempt, Ankara has been acting in Ankara since that week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt to overthrow the coup as" "God's gift", "as he gives him the opportunity to completely clean the Armed Forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really get a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Unhairy in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>

<seg id="2354">"in any case, the great job in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan fired more 7395 national ministers by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"at the same time, it seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military."</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the masters of the country before.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they puttied their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is driving purposefully an Islamization of the Armed Forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a particularly unnamed officer, who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt, the Turkish army would be" full of extremists and salafists in just a few years. "</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, an Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to begin to take her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a steppe-woman more progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion featuring pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible," enthuses True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, it also has its moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed upon conversation or it can" "be in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusion to rape, when one goes a step to Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, disturbs one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy was compared to a vibrator on his website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it is said on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates out of the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly sophisticated sex robots are emerging in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who prayred women to have sexual assault."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the worn body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistically this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornographic proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maids</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including Republican kinship with which they fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strangely on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"the dining table is certainly a good thing, but in a further context it seems to me that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the resultant action of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day will no longer repel us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% Income Tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like) - both compared to Trump are in fact one of very mild criminal offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks that await his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that no application has been fulfilled until now."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way - taking into consideration the regular periods of notice - is still enough time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts as a sub-authority for the administrative community, the applicant has to submit corresponding agreements."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they could no longer fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for their advice."</seg>

<seg id="2550">"the Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will strike about 1.5 million euros," "if we do it right," "says Wacker."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"for a city builder, there is a lot of room for design."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own yard and garden shed, it is possible to react flexibly to many."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what fits "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city construction master emphasizes."</seg>

<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the South railway line could be managed without any obstructions."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten people had dropped off Friday morning, two of them watched the long-distance traffic."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes gastric fights and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while people are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to detect a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice that carry a specific bacterium in its bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet more tolerant of tryptophan cause a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel loss if the same system also occurs in humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was however separated, had not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microscopy of mice had to be done - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced in DNA and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how bacteria were interfering with the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism which is known as an Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us are reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is likely something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2674">"at the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back at what happened so far."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in sensations."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the development area II of 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, previous renovations are a" achievement project "- it is finally important to also promote interior development, not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the District Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a sanitation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros are from the country, the rest from the community."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a rehabilitation area now?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will continue to investigate, so Schindler, where the" really old "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"it also plays a role, however, whether there is interest in the planned area."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the territorial borders could then be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge was represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"cellar presented the contents of the Confederation Programme" "Social City", "where the renovations were to be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The remediation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The funding period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the survey will be carried out only once, within the framework of which the persons involved in the rehabilitation department get a questionnaire to fill out the questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, as soon as possible the decrees are to take place, so that the restoration can begin in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann declared that each commune must carry out the said precursors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to assess the urban development of the city and to decide when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective plot, there will be a restructuring note in the land register."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will come again to sensibility and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that the project was an essential success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"this is why there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and property sheet", "where it is concerned, among other things, the structural condition and the restructuring views."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the grey questionnaire, the" "Household and housing arch", "information about the size, layout and habitations of a living room can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "operating bow" "is only to be filled out when the premises are operated in the building."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, it is important to note, that Gottwald pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for grants."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not eligible."</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler still stressed that the distribution of the subsidies in accordance with the "greyhound principle" - who first comes first grinds first.</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month, taxpayers will cost up to $24,000 in accordance with the military supplied to the TIME magazine."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck made from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi, the helicopter was built in Connecticut."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superior, the Deputy Marine commander for aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that on July 17, at 7am the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security guards remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"however, their use only for a photo operation is unusual."</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump carried out an investigation as the president's aircraft powered from the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, Taxi Services, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" "Made in America" "- the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," "said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crew frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to set the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 in the White House led 58 practice sessions."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted among the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours on this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said the taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary terms for the presidency, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of unit list the flight time of the plane more than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refunds is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement resolutions for DoD not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former president of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter's use for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present this week things that are made in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives and herded with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report about the abuse is relieved by Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen takes care of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after the publication of the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Cathedral Choir master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that in reporting on violence in the cathedral scrape," double standards "would be measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is a" shameful and shameful act "that would be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation "was striking, as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal," "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" you like to go to the church and this is a devoured fresco. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a very normal pedagogical instrument" "had been" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they found it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse cases, also Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely unjustly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoirs" My brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber from the diocese Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Ezekemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of non-violence at the site of protection found in the Regensburger Domspatzen "(Regensburger Domspatzen), is a contradictory picture of Cathedral Choir Champion Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students emphasize his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who has been handgrieved when a domcoil set no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you don't have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger ever appears in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is currently dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool were also expropriated outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can at best reproach him, experience it too late or have not taken the first hint seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the cathedral gymnasium on which it worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also depict him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who fed the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy, and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high level of emotionality, which also led to outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only bang with chairs and cast the keys on the ground, but also distributed ear-cowards and drew too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he already gave himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to be honest, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period of the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such methods of breeding as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, the terrible sexual abuse and the extortion of violence at the preschool, this is true of dredging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you wonder if it doesn't have to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still busy at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in all respects!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot has been reported on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be charged in the final report any involvement or co-worker with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted in the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said a person of concern for the others," "Everything was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who was professionally a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: "in terms of sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that... Buben are more urgent or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear conclusion:" that in the run-up affected students and / or their environment entrusted him, could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of all knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him from being prevented or brought to display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these atrocious crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was much to read about" "violent excesses" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of having "gazing out" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-sparrows, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, we say once, other vortices."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral scrape."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were victimized and portrayed, and suffered terribly, all acquired at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most of the witnesses put emphasis on, the subject of" "preschool" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacic" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the accusation still remains."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger consistently closed the ears ahead of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that, in the pre-school, he will continue to practice the test penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties in Bavaria had long been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected could perhaps exaggerate or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been crossed."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he always had looked at it."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in the year 1980 the test penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply the present pedagogical standards at that time, too."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "that is, the danger of judging the past according to present-day moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abhorrent and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the then practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, that is to draw earnest and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of its Regensburger Zeit, Georg Ratzinger played with you in the talks with you for the book" My brother of the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter test also go to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, recounts from his perspective, as the cathedral scrapers played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't mean by no means that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this too must be said: without this perfectionism without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candies alone, you don't even make a big vocalist and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience with Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, deep-loving, deeply believing and savoury people, from whom one can't imagine that he could only do something in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with him, like many former cathedral scrapers still today, 23 years after his accreditation, regularly contact him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he was strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the cathedral scrapers are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up today and which they almost honour."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and, please, once again clearly: all that one reproaches upon him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the stand, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
