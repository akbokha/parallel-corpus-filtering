&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up with him . &quot;
&quot; the body found in the West@@ field Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as a murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston six months ago , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were shocked at his death , and were destroyed by the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will not miss him , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things finally went up for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; to combine his style with his family was to always cook something for us , to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond who sh@@ one brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the dig@@ its of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or stuck on the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , a TV with delicious D@@ utt and Mexican food , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings the question about the desire of a child : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as an all@@ u@@ ding mother of two sons .
the film will start on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyr@@ amide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their evening , they drove home to the trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he left with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even go for photo purposes . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistant handed over to the man from An@@ hausen under a small gala the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
&quot; silver bay leaf , champion @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering young talent . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time American master winner was added to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um the hand @-@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the show stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a prin@@ ci@@ pled , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
about the role of the state .
&quot; Tru@@ mp aims to keep in doubt small and warn against how the state of the economy can harm the economy , with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to beat the economy to death and regulate to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will drive regulations massi@@ vely , and he is strongly committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes for the rich would be increased , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying . &quot;
the Democratic candidate is announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tru@@ mp , there could be no party @-@ internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are more prominent .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power stations and re@@ boot coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas ; he wants to announce the Paris Climate Protection Plan .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to specifically expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in terms of infrastructure , even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ one trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both , however , want to not isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , about Clinton . &quot;
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must be r@@ att@@ led , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics considered him , that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers shelter .
in a large kitchen four women are sitting .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a representative for social welfare services in Bavaria , and is dealing among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
&quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ centralized shel@@ ters for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors either .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences on her flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope carriers , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , moral murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who thinks that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and worst mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreciate it . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not invol@@ un@@ tarily . &quot;
many women were so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation is needed only for them , asks B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ al@@ z and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , government spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are several communal houses or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing , men and women are housed together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women easily , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; as the women feel the need for this protection , one can read the crowds it gives to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has spoken about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
assistance enti@@ t@@ ants strike : demands for new employment campaigns
assistant physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work @-@ fighting measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said the ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have remained a problem , which led to the refusal of the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Bureau announced today a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour struggles scheduled at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that , six times in the history of the N@@ HS , assistance physicians were fighting for six times . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A assistance physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that had been advised by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the treaty for physicians in England would be enforced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Beyond &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t for@@ bid myself of the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin sm@@ iled sm@@ iles and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report , all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
&quot; it was even bigger , since it was perpet@@ rated by a supposed friend . &quot;
building the cous@@ in again becomes difficult if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media held a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
&quot; the most serious accus@@ ations were alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had prof@@ ited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his office on a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it looks at its reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continued gru@@ dge over the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ ke to take advantage of the cool sen@@ timent and dimin@@ ish Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
the Russian head of state in Ankara won with certainty a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent one , as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel driven by the West and are badly treated and now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents spoke out at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately delayed a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on how a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian struggle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role according to the Bank &apos;s CEO . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sing and rescu@@ ed eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer stamps . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and stock market not@@ ations will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for retail , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re during a sightseeing tour .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor &apos;s brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;

&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit on Friday at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he is following Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20.000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori absor@@ bs the che@@ ers when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which only few have achieved before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a fans have been enthusiastic about this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and grand tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ or@@ rich Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive power to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not in the end yet - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest trust . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating grounds &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s has ruled out his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Vice President since 2012 , was named his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in Tall@@ inn , Estonia , he graduated from the renowned National Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) , that he later served as the director and chief of staff of the government . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; Thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding draft bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ caster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Put@@ ins and works like him for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country as Chief of Staff .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ igned at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as potential president suddenly wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy . &quot;
when Putin reached the power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of office had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another close allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who was playing the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his res@@ ignation . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the Gib@@ son character from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , will be released at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love criminal min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I was hoping to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be some 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion investment project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 different cast cables . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion investment project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Minister Keith Brown re@@ port@@ edly paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a concrete casting for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter represents future @-@ proof high and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last street cover section and its connection with the northern tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap on the north or north side . &quot;
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sacred activity .
&quot; massive since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances to which the team worked were tiny , they were only a few milli@@ metres on each side . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive
three men are lucky enough to be alive after they were thrown off by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm on Friday , after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming , while their boat was moving out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw the boat spinning around us and made the worst of us , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds blowing the boat out of reach , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boar@@ der without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat motor had a emergency stop@@ per , but this dis@@ b@@ anded the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - a man pun@@ ishes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 year old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol offen@@ ders cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he put on her twice . &quot;
the 44 year old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
they then al@@ er@@ ted their sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building Braunschweig inexpensive apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be obliged much more in the future . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next council meeting , the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first of all it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation has been missing so far .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments , however , can also be found in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the main point in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas , but building as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is intended to provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make as few regulations as possible to investors .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
&quot; regardless of his , so Brat@@ mann , there is a mat@@ ur@@ ation of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how can we offset the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose fo@@ stering is going to exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , according to planned spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , current ties from the city should now be purchased . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about getting the apartments back into the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
for in the west @-@ city the end of the year &apos;s deadlines exp@@ ire .
around 1800 apartments one could get there back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : the owners , the housing companies do not want . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West is increased dr@@ astically , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I have concentrated on more buildings for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; teen@@ ager and child no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been laugh@@ ed by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially set to the TV , then to video games and most recently to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created at first for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 1990s ( a series of animations , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) were created later . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest was dropped before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players with their smartphones go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons , which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( taken over a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation playing the game , when she was younger , joined the ahn and jumped for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a significant increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ fut@@ ed each day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; met deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people who look el@@ ap@@ pointing . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ estimated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships at the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also cru@@ el@@ ly toys that always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it to do ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people to hunt active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the women &apos;s urn
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the title title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es on the Swedish bar during the solo campaign of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title , and a total of the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
&quot; this success places them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; the last three years has dominated her sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ battle female of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ ly won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future , it is not true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost a competition competition , a winning series that will halt as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ a led by two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves . &quot;
floating beams and ground dunes - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ tered .
she got up again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and then placed another on the floor with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her funeral - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor exercise she threw out K@@ us@@ sh@@ unt &apos;s audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the fast spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning since the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers while listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous fall of Phoenix , were killed in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm as he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police informed that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 belonging to one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard &apos;s police spokes@@ man said that the shooting drove the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks during four months and two more were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge pou@@ ches and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his pe@@ ers , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let myself in .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her have been informed that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I did not know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of a help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund wrote for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as well as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional cost of an uncertain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; I have been asking for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; ra@@ ins in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards agreed that civil servants were in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the way to the communities affected .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have claimed ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach record levels throughout the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these flows over the beaten rivers flow only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still kno@@ cked people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and step@@ son were among those who were saved by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , has risen dramatically over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she never saw such a high tide of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the obstacles and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ we where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was considerably su@@ c@@ tioned by rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a two @-@ level secondary school in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which were both flooded .
&quot; the commander of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller told the authorities that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to return , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in Ham@@ mond , the city of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of dozens of roads were closed due to the flood of water and sand bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the City Council . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but no reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; holes perfor@@ ated , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police informs that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several gun@@ shots , including in the lung , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was ch@@ ased by bul@@ lets , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter with the fact that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class at a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot dead , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , were crow@@ ding the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is definitely an ongoing battle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were sleeves . &quot;
&quot; so there seems to have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were actively involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the Philadelphia police station in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police re@@ port@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another six @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a b@@ lower on her arm , when she played in front of her house in West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine among women &apos;s olymp@@ ics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ ś@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon is round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , yet master@@ ly gy@@ ms routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so do gymn@@ as@@ tics all over the country do not look like this . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all fought the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gymn@@ as@@ tics in the team . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ nes is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily comes into private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n innumerable , young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible exercise training . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ stiftung for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to the youth , who deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t unveiled plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistants should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend plac@@ ements , in order to improve the maintenance at un@@ favourable times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A committee for assistant physicians , shared last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors appropriately . &quot;
&quot; in only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by the government strug@@ gled with the government for reluct@@ ance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the raising and address the concerns of the assistants . &quot;
&quot; should he fail to do so , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments since nur@@ ses and doctors were included to cover doctors in the strike @-@ mail chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to improve week@@ end@@ ages for the 5@@ 4,000 assistants who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , called on the assistants to quit the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working Campa@@ ig@@ ns achieve nothing but little , but already pol@@ lu@@ te teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the pharmac@@ ist of the Assist@@ ants and responded positively to concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ning with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional break , training cad@@ a@@ vers , reci@@ pro@@ cal recognition of the curriculum , continuing education of England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulation authority recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that c@@ aches the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and stop the flow of blood to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ICE pipeline , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Healthcare Research Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively helps reduce further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; with a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture makes electoral fraud blo@@ oming in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to know@@ ingly ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former member of the cabinet , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , verb@@ ally attacks the police , elec@@ tive observers and town halls to ignore the evidence of election ab@@ uses based on &quot; &quot; suspicion of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and the Local Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside elec@@ ting cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should demonstrate their identity , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er just has to call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , when they give up their vote to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial investment culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special arbit@@ ration court decided that the current mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cally &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation when someone else chooses one .
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly in the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter @-@ election - in which the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean@@ se the electoral system , including conducting failure to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as proof it is appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... governmental institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; sensi@@ tivities in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists manipul@@ ate postal voting records to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before you vote for your ID .
&quot; do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out to ensure that they are in@@ eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists process complete correspondence and envel@@ opes of postal cuts .
the police give the authority to set up barriers for election stations .
a change of the law facilit@@ ated by an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Rights Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that staff rule out that voters go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements of the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ points &quot; of the voting registration departments of the City Council .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler double @-@ go@@ er and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who proved to be an impressive du@@ ke of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only athle@@ tic ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe in the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; hunter and wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet showed how a certain arc of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
the team member of the US squ@@ ad in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly like the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a ben@@ ign fellow , so I guess that is a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons ever since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a , with her big , expressive eyes , is said to be a double @-@ cat@@ cher for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a hall@@ way higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a points out more than just the sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American was att@@ ested to fans of fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there may be one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons were Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Gab@@ by Douglas turbine , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ in &quot; died &quot; like a pig

&quot; the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float was &quot; as low off &quot; and died during the race like &quot; a pig . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ sty@@ ling team he gave his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was taken on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS , to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as M@@ ief died , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming season 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to open the gap to China . &quot;
audiences across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emma Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ in from China &quot; &quot; died &quot; &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on air .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m ( 4 x 200 m ) outdoor swimming team for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ Jack Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the commentary was broadcast on a swimming capacity . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the news on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night to our audience and our followers in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of float and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s cre@@ mat@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have been referring to the performance of float , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman with@@ drew her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the situation worse , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked in it , pulled her off and put her back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the shop at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she came back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , nau@@ ghty as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to recover and went out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b her that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home trousers with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and had not been washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer to your predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if one approaches you from behind , then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the gun between your front arm and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knees in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er squee@@ zes before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon against him . &quot;
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight on the gun and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler dra@@ gged his immune system and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis of a serious test - by li@@ cking some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sn@@ apped his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing head of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; prior to the leak@@ age of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to take . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the idea to lick off the r@@ ins@@ ing head of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el , traveling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to dish@@ washers of toilets , the task assigned his immune system definitely among a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said , &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ ous number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s coming close to the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more ridi@@ culous than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation .
&quot; the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D. in order to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ ori@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our common environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film &apos;s direction , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , particularly with the well @-@ being of ga@@ stri@@ c and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria added . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ ach@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cking employees of the housing cooperative found property in irre@@ parable condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls pointed windows , wooden floors were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which might be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found . &quot;
&quot; in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up &quot;
neighbors said they had to fight on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ oned her and her partner for@@ c@@ efully from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now , when they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added , &quot; &quot; It is a shame that tenants can agree to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the last step taken into account by Corn@@ wall housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the floor
workers in the house management will now have to move away garbage mountains surrounding the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don gained a fine after she had become guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial sight .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ o@@ ge rent@@ ers who do not obey the rules of the house
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed Angela C@@ row that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not obey the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
&quot; tourists in Portugal in panic , after a flying military jet flies the beach &quot;
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their life &quot;
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force placed an unbelievable storm flight
&quot; the Air Force reported that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk . &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a bus@@ h@@ y jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun@@ dial bet@@ tors on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle systems , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added , &quot; I &apos;ve just been surfing and it felt like the airplane dropped to me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were put in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese air strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said the jet flew lower than usual due to poor visibility conditions , but the air force insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; this summer , area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , with four people on the island Madeira to death . &quot;
the Portuguese air strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his vision .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot f@@ isher boats had to identify as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
the Dou@@ ble@@ w@@ inner must rel@@ inqu@@ ish with the defeated cup@@ in@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
&quot; in addition , there is also a lack of Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a b@@ anding in the knee during the training , so at least for the time being Bar@@ ca had clari@@ fied the request for Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining Candi@@ dates res@@ ig@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; before the first compulsory play of the new season , the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
at 3 : 2 Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
&quot; with up to now eleven successes , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in an own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and title defender , Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , the world rank@@ ings won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and precisely Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ est@@ ants on their own in fair competition .
&quot; the matches until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said lo@@ gically . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver medals posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ al .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma had to fight only in the first sentence . &quot;
after that he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang out of 13 points .
&quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the unexpected boun@@ cing match did not develop . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , enough stunning ball changes to be seen were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White Etrus@@ can had contracted a rival , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have also become Olympic Vi@@ erte with similarly high table tennis tables . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp grants ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Republi@@ can is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states losing their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now has weaknesses in his election campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as little as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; Tru@@ mp said before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; being guilty of false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
republi@@ can high @-@ castles w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tru@@ mp and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were likewise . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp at the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also valid . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will &quot; either be successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if for him , in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party has threatened Tru@@ mp to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger to attack the Congress . &quot;
Olympia : thre@@ ef@@ old che@@ ating at Dop@@ ing @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second Dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; following a test attempt at a Dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan feature told the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as from dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; IA@@ AF has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case , to ex@@ ert its own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; according to the results of the study and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will assess an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and gave himself up as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; stated K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth more than 800 meters .
&quot; four days earlier , Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ ich was taken off by the Rio games . &quot;
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against the sports@@ men of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport . &quot;
&quot; at the IO@@ C , Kenya is already under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing contracts for a long time . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer Games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency has exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in this way , it could be proven that in this kind of sport it became surface @-@ overl@@ apping and systematic . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot;
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ der Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli puts the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you can see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , this is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ch@@ ic@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as those at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , was reported to have died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said her family was hearing from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bas@@ tion of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the land @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from the East of London got into a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton would stay as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of election victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the US presidential candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the affir@@ mation of Gar@@ lands since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects to choose Gar@@ land from Clinton with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not be wor@@ rying about a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the post office .
Tre@@ ats wants to have nude calendar for &quot; women and men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his n@@ ak@@ y magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys is distingu@@ ishable as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do that for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the view that it does the calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classic nude , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally during open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; those who do not conform and Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Di@@ alogue and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protection @-@ seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; the chair@@ person Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh repression of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime further fights the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chair@@ person Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already crossed short @-@ term strongh@@ olds with sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the vain coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state which absor@@ bs refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Staff compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
that is why Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Chief of the Association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critic is taking place . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , I am no longer feeling safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not adapt to and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Stiftung Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seekers recognized by political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this has been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 percent of all eligible candidates ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , those who are not afraid of war , poverty or lack of perspective can be found . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individual persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more than now it does not work : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the choice fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most holiday makers , who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no locals , so may not choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems arise : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , disper@@ se air ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count towards the end of the votes . &quot;
&quot; by September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass once again election campaigns to the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in p@@ olls clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; what is exciting is how much newcom@@ er Af@@ D is cutting off , and what remains in the end of co@@ ali@@ tions dust . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , he sees from his major posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spread roses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just like his legendary for@@ e@@ word predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , with its peak candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag election circuit is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany once again to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the Union has noted that in the country , it cru@@ mb@@ les the base that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering called his SPD in an especially committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the S &amp; D Group la@@ gged 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clearly at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the state day . &quot;
&quot; from vacation times , they make a modern virtue and reloc@@ ate their campaign largely to the Internet . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on @-@ line campaign &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tors go on a search for clu@@ es for local voters . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , currently cur@@ v@@ ates with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even nice . &quot;
their impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ remedi@@ ation : inn@@ s suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end up at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the half @-@ season , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the decision will also be v@@ owed to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to furnishing accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides again .
the cre@@ denti@@ al traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were sometimes significant complaints , &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ way@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ aks were seeking and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ tic .
&quot; as the speed limits were not observed , the municipality also called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself able to know himself about the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has gone further , it has become cal@@ mer . &quot;
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to a rise in revenue , each one asks to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight decline , &quot; &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course , &quot; &quot; walking &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the street .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , Ste@@ ak@@ house owner , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit him &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; the revenues earned revenue acc@@ esses &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the structuring of the street stopped its operation &quot; by two years .
he had to release half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other country circles where such things have been handled more gener@@ ously .
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ kli@@ fts return after the renovation work .
&quot; in spite of the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner is holding the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis he experienced in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the terrorist fight , it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , interior minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a tolerance status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is the ser@@ vers@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable for the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t challenge anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in it .
&quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented a little time before presenting his conclusions for the security in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; this , however , is all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; some things are already known , announced , announced , filed : that a new security authority shall take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to kno@@ ck out the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; he ad@@ mits to the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; it still holds this for reasonable and doesn &apos;t require anything , which in the case of coalition partners does not have any chances anyway . &quot;
&quot; a few new ideas , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents . &quot;
some of them have in themselves : he plans quick @-@ action for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
&quot; refugees that are being targeted into the country should check their smartphones in advance , and open social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; in case of tolerance for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse positions than until now - such as to commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of it is politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
some of these are still uns@@ ett@@ led and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror . &quot;
but it can &apos;t be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that deeply dealt with people could not be clas@@ sed , even in election times . &quot;
the inner security has been tremend@@ ously put into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Union and SPD are increasingly putting themselves in a position on the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went up high . &quot;
&quot; first a gar@@ sti@@ y dispute about the equipment of the federal police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the ministers also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he considers nothing . &quot;
we have discussed the discussion in Germany .
re@@ plen@@ ish it is not sensible .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and if it is indeed &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to show up . &quot;
there is a lot of things in it that could cause controversy .
&quot; at the moment , the SPD is also trying to benefit from internal security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly sign@@ al@@ ises cau@@ tious conversation and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is getting off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery volumes are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it is not in all markets .
&quot; in the recall campaign , there is confusion about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year for deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite the diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can boast a plus in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the total sales again , as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot;
&quot; sales alone in Western Europe , the second most important market in China , were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth . &quot;
head of Sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there has been a decline in sales in some core markets due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ par@@ ap@@ ers first escal@@ ated , a minus can also be found . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected family brand of the Lower Saxony is already lightly handled by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a distribution minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales Fred Kap@@ pler posted a sales increase from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen made up 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated on Friday in company circles . &quot;
reason to be j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen is now offering its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models . &quot;
&quot; this was confirmed last Monday , VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
VW has fulfilled the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA .
&quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output will not take place after the conversion , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust fault , it comes to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul , head of banking , said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 clients who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers need not &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee charges the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits above 100,000 euros on checking or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time he kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros .
he now continues the cost according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
&quot; leaving the cash simply in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth place yet , &quot; said the banking executive . &quot;
most clients would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operatives Association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to bear alone , &quot; &quot; economically sustainable &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore raised their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 had head@@ lines with pun@@ ishments for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay blanket fees for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; There is a clientele at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , endowed with a wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if it pays for free money . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund founded in 1911 in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are currently known to charge a compensation for deposits from private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany won &apos;t like this in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before comm@@ itting to the comment section , to look at it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ Alle@@ yn Men &apos;s middle @-@ ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely generation of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a horror by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and gra@@ zing wild before I stand , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
&quot; art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men of middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already value , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , rev@@ et the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and re @-@ bought items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were somewhat too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets will apply to You@@ Go@@ v @-@ Profile . &quot;
&quot; he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy again their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people generally dischar@@ ged their collection in such a way around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of supporters of the record @-@ revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a store like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers were offen@@ ded by the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound record sleeves , from objects that evoke joyful adjustments . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is with me as a collector so and I think it is so for many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff fle@@ es from a pile of pil@@ es . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I plan@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ like , less musi@@ cally clas@@ sy . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor , has a pale audience than I am going in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts New@@ est Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ stra@@ pped pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ aned from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but serious mental trauma is hard to determine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of sheets available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window shopping than a wholesale purchase .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I seem to be giving the appearance of mu@@ ff@@ ling jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are looking for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter are thinking about buying a cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there &apos;s nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates . &quot;

French court refuses offer of dis@@ armament of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be fu@@ elled by selling 72 temporary shops where people within the camp are selling goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , selling hair@@ dressing services or selling tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and which have a fire and health risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also explained that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp which is generally operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition , in order to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
the two help organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants have estimated on Friday that the number of refugees living in the jungle has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , at highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed @-@ polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ under for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access restrictions to time , stri@@ pe and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also slip @-@ proof outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the Vit@@ ronic information in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain fet@@ ches Silver in 7 @-@ hour Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year @-@ old Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the shape of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the Te@@ odoro stage in Rio .
&quot; Fiji divided a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , night@@ fall , line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic med@@ alist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was won by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , a 15 @-@ man team would have been in best shape with this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ it tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago under R@@ yan they lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is ast@@ ounding . &quot;
Fiji started wonderfully and bla@@ sted the attacks of G@@ Bs out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au r@@ ushed out in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a tent@@ ative T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , the ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a went down a touch@@ down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji was born to play 7 , while the UK is still learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ian gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant Inter@@ play from Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sw@@ ung , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame translated the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked sm@@ ashed in the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match of the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown took the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspir@@ es the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ inal gold as with these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 tough guys who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ad in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 3@@ 9th im@@ pending deployment , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans that do not reflect the type of triumph .
&quot; behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference , and there was no one but the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ king .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it is spreading everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that is the correct term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that is how it starts .
&quot; rowing is a challenge , but it makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a more nerve @-@ ri@@ cher morning talking about something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain at the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to be a train@@ ee or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we didn &apos;t want to make some Tol@@ les .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; next week Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide exemplary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water pur@@ ge as a model for the big water producers .
&quot; some time ago , it was called the original sound in a contribution by Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia dig@@ ni@@ fied the con@@ federation .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide as exemplary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was at the age of 31 , stands for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and a hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
water supply contracts are available for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and has been appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency missions on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the flood containers ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the regeneration of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and there are always new additions , because water is life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation , she commen@@ ded Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over the past 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water pur@@ se and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia District . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , lau@@ ded water atten@@ dant Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water atten@@ dant and he was a loyal companion .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well structure and re@@ structure of the purpose association . &quot;
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture in the can@@ ister at church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the hop@@ per of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;

&quot; on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and injured it mort@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him become public . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Sven S. could be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a lat@@ ch . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the gun with him , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. should call 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ness or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a crime of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not say more at this time , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special service command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - flash@@ back for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition at the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ flow production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers , the gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption , to register . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry rose additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will fall . &quot;
but this also does not rise in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for its own electricity generation .
&quot; as a result , the status quo is largely ens@@ hr@@ ined in the previous regulation . &quot;
the successful effort by Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the issue of emissions , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation further ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel impact , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up . &quot;
&quot; how sustainable is the price pick@@ up , is unclear . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been more stagn@@ ant again . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to close the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturers are careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the German economic association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the amount recovered now went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in output in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does good sen@@ iors well &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , at the Magi@@ st@@ erium studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler states from the German sen@@ iors division . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures often dissolve in old age , then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly request their lungs get out of the box as quickly as they are in everyday life .
&quot; even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Association of sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people who suffer from dementia suffer from long @-@ coming events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , a special achievement is required to the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; even older people , who live alone , practice so , not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I practise for something long , I will better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks having little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;

cats react more sensi@@ tively than cat to the cries of the young
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover the effect the rep@@ atri@@ ation of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the male also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to caus@@ tic sounds , which are in great need , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males also react to the calls of kit@@ ten - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cries are different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of MH@@ H .
they were played for a lit@@ le of little ones who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more powerful k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited kit@@ ten played . &quot;
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women react more sensi@@ tively to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ er@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , a major football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already in the fall of the state of emergency following the attempt to overthrow the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , football is not stopped even before football . &quot;
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
&quot; accordingly , the South Korean living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency originally imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the night @-@ time &quot; democracy guard &quot; in public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan has declared for an end on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at cups &quot; Gala , &quot; it will take place especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne celebrated its sporting value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also eliminated early in the European League . &quot;
in the South Li@@ g it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of playing was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the base for the 14th title with 26 seasonal figures as the Southern Li@@ g Tor@@ ment@@ or King . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; following the coup attempt at the AC Florence under contract , the Gom@@ ez was only announced after the attempt of the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , because of the political situation in the country after his European holidays . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storm would have to be ready to refrain from about a third of its annual treas@@ ury worth 7.5 million euros , &quot; Or@@ man said clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have medals of medals at Olympia in Rio
J@@ ustin &apos;s 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other ab@@ duc@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented her starting right before the games after a Dop@@ ing lock , was ph@@ ased out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenario : with a raised smile , she was still standing in the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a jam @-@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are numerous other athletes , who go to the Olympic Games in Rio despite the Dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had already been closed for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain through Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic fought the know@@ ingly ing@@ es@@ tion and was locked for six months .
the four most far@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ ess .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been positively tested and closed for 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , be@@ amed Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was subsequently recognized as many medals afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his championship title from 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid drugs and the Euro title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; in 2008 , the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was given back to the International Sports Court CA@@ S . &quot;
at 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the World R@@ ank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record holder and gold fav@@ ori@@ ess was first tested in May , but still can start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the ing@@ es@@ tion of a banned dietary supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA was mild and expi@@ red on 13 July . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al cas@@ u@@ alties
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Office , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left the hospital . &quot;
her home trip was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explosive missions went up again , another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
&quot; at the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast demanded several injuries . &quot;
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee , Friday early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but most likely it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ astic isolated separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received intelligence evidence of im@@ minent attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and locations . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police showed their officials across the country to enhance security for important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not address tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the current bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends its website to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improving economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , has given itself the privilege of having restored the Kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok by a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is targeted at the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; according to several Provin@@ cial Off@@ ices , the constitutional guard in the Con@@ federation also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; identity movement &apos; clu@@ es for efforts against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ ning Chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ zel of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional obj@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ bears . &quot; &quot;
he said that his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities when deciding on the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the head of the constitution . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to this .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
he said that he had no knowledge .
&quot; for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this type are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor is , therefore , whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot;
this may not be dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ za said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be legally ror@@ ist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee @-@ seekers or attacks from other extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legi@@ tim@@ ism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ g expressed concern that many attacks came to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the suspect attacks on asylum accommodation had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were politically in@@ different or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts who then radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sen@@ timent . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; not always , the Olympics or World Records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently converted to viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his trial with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly spor@@ tive figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
&quot; as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first top names made the round .
some media called it the &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; inspired him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ se@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool in A@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete on his own in a run of over 100 metres of Liberty style . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ en@@ etic , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim just eight months before the Olympic and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left her business on Monday at 5 : 30 pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;

Tru@@ mp is not seeing the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on vacation .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; in the end it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if for him at the end for reasons of political correctness do not suff@@ ice , that is fine , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;

post increases in trade with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms on the vehicle is obviously large .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter too .
&quot; soon , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post wants to offer its electric v@@ ans from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they are to sell their own developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ ot@@ ers , with the letters and pack@@ ets , as well as to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ der said , there will always be inquiries , such as by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company is planning to build up to 10,000 automobil@@ es per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ den had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long term , make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we put the entire fleet around .

GF@@ RP leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the revers@@ ing came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing annual figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate leadership , the world &apos;s number five in the industry is facing a new beginning . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the Executive Board of G@@ RP will leave the company . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the supervisory body with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; the management of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ man@@ ner@@ inger as early as September 1 , divided the company . &quot;
he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; spokes@@ man for the Chief Executive Officer &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found .
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details wanted to not call an spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; if the market research company will be leading the market research company in future , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was said on Friday , in the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every investor will become rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros were shr@@ inking by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter , earnings in the second quarter were mainly imp@@ acted by the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , generated a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the line . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still managed to generate a profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus slip into Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors .
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her data , had to devi@@ ate from an opposite vice , who drove partly on the counter @-@ track . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund mentioned .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and one emergency ambul@@ ance arrived at the Land@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back by a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner District P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the tour company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of wastewater will amount to 2.@@ 10 euros instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an over@@ ly calculation , the wastewater fee in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget , Kul@@ mb@@ ach , the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , found that under@@ coverings have been under cover for these sewage systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost @-@ covering basis . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ to@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as head of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed up , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period will also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the severe fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small , with a very low waste water waste , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , due to the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculation period of all three plants , renovation and repair expendi@@ tures fell in a considerable scope , not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt noted that in the sewage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced as a result of a damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be evacu@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses the continued support and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were substantially below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the course of the low waste water in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully sm@@ ashed .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt added that the market community of large entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed during the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the waste water association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal cannot be extended because these facilities are defici@@ ent facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 a rise in prices for the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) , restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
snapshot &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows a snapshot of around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ flo@@ wer@@ ed , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mal@@ functions go public .
&quot; in the past , the Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of promoting black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat told that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters rather than car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others declined the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student of art whose tweet was widely spread across the photos , was that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mild . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow @-@ face was pulled into the dropping extrem@@ ity . &quot;
snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural mile .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rapid @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , the company le@@ aned to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel officer focused on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects Congress Committee &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence official information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , reported a report of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Army Committee , Intelligence and Military Intelligence reports , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence gathering intelligence , typically attracted by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , posted a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground , and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
&quot; the ten @-@ page report presents detailed , persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces . &quot;
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ com has publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin already in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command tops changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigations continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports are being conducted by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the High Level Democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the mor@@ ale amongst analysts and &quot; gave excessive amount of room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s In@@ spec@@ tor , who was taken up after complaints from Cent@@ com &apos;s analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor were still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful aerial campaign conducted under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , alleg@@ ations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret formations of the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush showed only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker den@@ ies government agencies that contrary to the statements of the government air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in the field of women &apos;s hockey , a show@@ down with the UK is pending &quot;
&quot; one day after having fired three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she cannot remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
but she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are at the first place in their group with the Brit@@ ons who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path leading the other group .
&quot; as always , the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have spark@@ ed a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things into a better way . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we have now .
we have completely ri@@ pped the ru@@ dder .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a fr@@ enzi@@ ed relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow arch@@ ers to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the conflict between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well @-@ being TV ads when he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not immediately illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make some modest arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many people , I had asked , didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete , who made it to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
&quot; trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlightened ears for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and scuba diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ ol@@ ines , which means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to move a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to version , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ ons hoping to go further up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further under@@ pinn@@ ed goal in TV trans@@ missions : the world or the Olympic Record . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she is boun@@ cing off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , moves upwards , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant ann@@ ul@@ ment of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition in the Olympics can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympic man@@ ia they promise a calm , nice moment , one that will probably be over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ gling and the objective of male athletes - as the male American Tur@@ ner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his air rin@@ se , new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , demanding political changes in Ethiopia , met the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot;
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia just breaking together ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more regions . &quot;
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and asked fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was not rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa &apos;s project manager of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads tend to be quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options out of prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ la , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
one generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the governing coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ si@@ ghted vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ ga@@ den Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den which have been forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess are now explo@@ ding under the surface after years of noise .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and improve Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed that they were so protests gathered .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ h@@ as , who from Ethiopia are predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ h@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ bly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ers who account for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , when thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , which , according to analysts , apparently passed away from the government and were subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest relatively quickly passed . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but evi@@ dently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ances of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ res@@ ian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently confirmed that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his comrades who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of having to declare statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; having made reference to an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp threw back on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
but in an early morning twe@@ ets on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the charge was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t asked Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism boun@@ ces down to Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign for falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp was trying to return to this subject again . &quot;
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull .
Mr. Tru@@ mp already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself as he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits of politics and then to ru@@ de back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his asser@@ tions vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp accepted an estimated sound as his cargo values went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to not ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while empha@@ sizing the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s asser@@ tion whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind legs , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Clinton neighborhood , served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by aggres@@ sively controlling the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; prior to the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp was continuing his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who tried to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats compla@@ ined about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; once upon a market price , Café in Green@@ point is back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted coffee shop in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served a good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ ront were sup@@ planted . &quot;
&quot; soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , replacing Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people seized it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also a re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time associate of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new external source , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ties such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are signs of nature .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez told him that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , used to live in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo : Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gru@@ dge over the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap to bre@@ w the coffee in the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will still deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish people , green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated the menu into Polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he proposed to put them out soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt@@ y said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a passion for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they show culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a small , car@@ essed snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable mix ate . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap to stretch the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have placed itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways in which the country has moved around , no longer to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods , such as bre@@ ads and br@@ asser@@ ol@@ es , became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way of re@@ ass@@ uring food residues &quot; , &quot; when coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; odd mixtures were tried out , as a high @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular additive at lun@@ ch@@ time , &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the domestic recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - promoted the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ keeping &quot; &quot; and the challenge to turn pamp@@ h@@ lets like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ myself @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude , are tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man from the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully alien .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to leave an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country came back to its feet .
&quot; the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to foods . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple better understood the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how she could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; brick @-@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleaned up at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e emerged a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe which President Roosev@@ elt did for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , and added that it was a handy trick to send a modest name to modest recipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took a thri@@ ce three times .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died during a bom@@ b@@ astic attack from the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 lives . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk , in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian shelter , which shows him during a 11 hour rescue of a mam@@ mal from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said loud : &quot; &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have thrown four drums over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; the image c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland hairs usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , this lon@@ ge@@ vity based lifestyle seems to be a pat@@ ron@@ age for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock comments this life span , which for verteb@@ rates means a world record . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected long ago , Greenland &apos;s hair was stone @-@ old . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to watch , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated shores of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
&quot; their slow @-@ up tempo was , as they found six animals in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; this sh@@ arks nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the l@@ enti@@ l core of the sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks were notably carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l core .
&quot; her birth , therefore , should be after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons tests carried out large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , with 220 centimet@@ ers of length of the third smallest animal , on the other hand , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus with@@ stands a slight surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ l core , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long grass @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers would be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ female only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of length could assign an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ ema live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often become particularly big . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal absor@@ bs heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
&quot; with themes relating to building , the municipal council has focuss@@ ed on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee assumed the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the development , par@@ cel@@ eration and inquiry questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be made , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Street lane &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Council is convinced that the cultivation areas in the rural and quiet residential community , Schön@@ au attract young families and sen@@ sel@@ ess sen@@ iors in equal measure . &quot;
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ linge can register in the town hall right away . the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to fulfil requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of further industrial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ timely lar@@ n , the business area already shown there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; as a result , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Department of Excellence Financial Markets and I@@ W &apos;s real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary homes continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it has already been granted approval in the UK . &quot;
that is why we are using just large US banks .
several banks have already announced that jobs should be stored .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Board , ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg dispos@@ es of a large fund industry , it is also snow@@ ing like Dublin with the infrastructure worse . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city with easily available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder says . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;

&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; the balance of forces also speaks : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 people . &quot;
Gilead acqu@@ ires legal costs of hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US administrative judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was freed from damages amounting to $ 200 million for the infringement of two Mer@@ ck patents pending in connection with block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman stated that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ance on costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took advantage of each other and claimed property based on laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
U.S. supported troops say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the US supported the complete control of the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( TP@@ MS ) are currently comb@@ ing the city , following the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the military council of Reu@@ ters allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clearing work , &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State paid a USD 3 million in@@ comes to her book on her term of office in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign leader J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a tax inspection by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp &apos;s special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish anything before the tax inspections failed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other ties , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton already fell on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp request his tax return to be published .
&quot; on Thursday , she also spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politicians have reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure people who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the I@@ RS , and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return to 2007 .
&quot; Clinton &apos;s , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clinton Doc@@ tr@@ ine of 2015 showed that they received only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote dance ani@@ as elephant shield &quot;
&quot; natural conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea already years ago , has intensified its promotion along with U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World telephone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without any harm to the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi wool &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mix with the earth together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , its end up to the ignition cord is turned . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spark@@ les fine dust in the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already enough to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a thro@@ wer , who shoots a golden fire@@ work in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
city council votes unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk @-@ building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Investment Projects take place by business@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be considerably boo@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; however , the municipal council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ki@@ osk on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Congress . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
&quot; Jewish director breaks up Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots gri@@ pped a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election since it had claimed Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels .
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
he wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a way to select Israel from its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; cho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they have requested that the pre @-@ election will be er@@ ased , &quot; the staff of Lanz@@ mann cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have reproduced the alleged promp@@ tings of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel soon dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the Quick Choice list &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police op@@ poses Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to put rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ mu@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ffi@@ cking against the preliminary president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in the masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trading between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , distributed the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the commercial break was achieved by supplying machinery , agricultural vehicles and arms , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year the Russian foreign minister issued about 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourist arri@@ vals in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
&quot; on Thursday evening , a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL has been practi@@ sed at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße . &quot;
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had embra@@ ced their faces , demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been exploited , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
&quot; after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators have to be stra@@ ined in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking space situated opposite the car park entrance , possibly lie in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
anyone who has taken observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should urgently need to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer days
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their assistants during their summer release in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
the life @-@ joyful group during the first school holiday week was lod@@ ged in the quiet area of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ end with the visit to the mat@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group was delighted at the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the culinary delights were given to children and car@@ et@@ akers with their self @-@ prepared star@@ ters such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , it was designed to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings by the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch @-@ St. Anna &apos;s pastoral care unit were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were accomplished . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time as far as the next Romanesque pilgrimage of all min@@ ts in the period of two years , the Upper minist@@ erial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where , during this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the opened portal of mercy on Freiburg Münster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms made their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Rev@@ . Stor@@ es sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b he was driven by rail to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Our Lady stands , and thus the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse in the morning and evening , with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els and churches always made a stop to sing together a song from a specially created pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , past@@ ors of the local par@@ ishes stood at their disposal . &quot;
&quot; Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided for a tasty , hearty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
the second day we went through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after the day , the stage came to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but in the case of high heat some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again afterwards . &quot;
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the beach in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon , and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is of the Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed by the Min@@ is pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home as Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the not@@ ch that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the J@@ ump and legend hau@@ led the legend when he stor@@ med home to make a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as Hin@@ ds .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner won an olymp@@ ic record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his turn , Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation that drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make myself a name .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side there were indications that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is possible in the field of the possibility that he will win Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; saying , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; he had fought yesterday with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a tro@@ op of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background Dr@@ amas played in the background , leaving the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing issues , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks like the now legendary call G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the abolition of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria , as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operators announce the energy supply contract and thereby lift all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the plant &apos;s operation . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effect , as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the overall electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ t@@ down of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money , ris@@ king a closure . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L believes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L further said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which would have come into effect in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the earnings of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L informed that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt or to ensure the supply to melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have come into force from November this year , even if there is still a question of why it has withdrawn from the contract . &quot;
analysts are warning of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems were to disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in the demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a car@@ th@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a cre@@ eping reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( except for the Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problem cases and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ coated plot nearly every birthday episode of a child &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris has had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beating the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most popular issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a volume resem@@ bling a ribbon as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising on the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak@@ age before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she finds herself in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people from today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even though it all applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her . &quot;
these emotions sounded high again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but the point seems to pass over to the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she is running for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ée Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their pay@@ wall apps .
&quot; she is sold by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine &quot; &quot; LOVE &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and in her spare time , she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot;
&quot; community centers show 160@@ ,000 people annually &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary countries are aver@@ ted annually by the community centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further short@@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are dismissed on their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is envis@@ aged that these legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s communal police centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Commun@@ al Centers has revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without lifting the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families that were released by separ@@ ations , workers who were un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they do not receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut its funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice , as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Ele@@ ction Campa@@ ign indic@@ ted after employee allegedly drew weapons
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after telling her that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February had directed a fire@@ arm to a staff while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident will be described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i promised to have waited for months , that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ord@@ i gave in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he announced in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to do harm , &quot; &quot; stated B@@ ord@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owner and weapon friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges should appoint judges . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not be offen@@ ded by violence .
B@@ ord@@ is &apos;s complaint requires compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and lasting mental damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Press Press Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip did not fail .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; calls to his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries Elec@@ tions : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the government party SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot;
these were representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after survey data in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to stand up to the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD r@@ ushed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at the Land@@ tag with 19 percent for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were back to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented at the Land@@ tag in each case . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) reports only 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it is thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates wouldn &apos;t miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , and this would suff@@ ice for roughly two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to businesses exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as the &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , although slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story even though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft .
&quot; today , the market is domin@@ ating vendors that all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; ever and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone there has been a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO announced Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World to introduce i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communication channel , all easy to use with touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; after all , she disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away even , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , member of the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction in He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions were benef@@ iting from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities we will create 10,000 new teaching positions alone , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ end on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion of wit@@ ty growth , and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the heart of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to supply a third running ste@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers try to b@@ ypass advertising blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook told us that his des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding related to his advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect the indication of what part of the site is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams spokes@@ man said that &quot; this kind of hate @-@ and @-@ forth struggle has already been underway between the inviting open source community and the det@@ ain@@ ees since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue streams . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on a Facebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on Desktop PC accounts for a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook seems to be worthwhile investment of such a step . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook told us that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook declared that Ad@@ blocks would be more wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we instead focus on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman suspected of suicide on Swiss free@@ way
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police witnesses witnesses after a woman was convic@@ ted in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 who was driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said , asking them and every witness of the incident to sign up . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases , in which a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian flows in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after passing a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and became unconscious in the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the police -- which had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; totally extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly shifted . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the gradual turn of the Venus expon@@ ents its day@@ time side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces ra@@ ins creating a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of the Venus that resembles evolution previously assumed by planet explor@@ ers .
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; when their hydro@@ gen with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a small co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
during the summer I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
&quot; in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick told me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was recognized as the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adam Awards .
&quot; he took the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the low season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike on strike &quot;
&quot; the labour disputes relating to wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all parties sit down at the table for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; says a joint statement . &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start early next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which was the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by some 9 percent as a result of negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s down@@ turn follows a 10 percent drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the necessary space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to rise to new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ traum@@ atic Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star cluster rotate to different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods can be associated with planet creation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancers , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now rotating the fastest way .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these mature stars col@@ li@@ de large amounts of star win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger star pi@@ rou@@ ettes faster than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us about what we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why Stars will slow down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star emerges
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will last the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; , declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game @-@ player of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been selling 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary . &quot;
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the bas@@ eball hall . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted having taken the banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , due to a involvement in the so @-@ called bio @-@ genesis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received funding for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the ban was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time swe@@ at@@ y . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends play the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the circumstances with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , was rap@@ ed by the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ bish@@ op@@ ric Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught up : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh day of the race , the first official dop@@ ing events have become well @-@ known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese flo@@ ats Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle @-@ runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news comes to an end . &quot;
&quot; last Sunday in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the runs of more than 50 m of free style . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and requires full co @-@ operation among the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio the news pla@@ in@@ ed about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; the ath@@ lete explained . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance will be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended temporarily , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample was also expected to be positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete &apos;s report .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation can not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both best@@ ow the taking , however , both of them may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had banned the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ vor Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the past off@@ ences in China also ensured violent confron@@ tations between the athletes . &quot;
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of fre@@ estyle I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested at the Chinese Championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data E@@ ger : so per@@ fi@@ de gro@@ unding h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently attacking companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware Defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware replacement . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators in order to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes adver@@ sely on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , potentially le@@ thal ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently witn@@ essing an alar@@ ming rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months swiftly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ genesis . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a Ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German firms affected lost revenue losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; many hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
&quot; in view of stand@@ still in operation , it is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims by chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , establish freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private persons are redeemed according to payments of a few hundred euros , companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the former malware kits have been created by helping malware , advice , and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is well @-@ known for many companies that better secure their data . &quot;
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing policies , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take up completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat that was connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heater might be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V works rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit surface drops off . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l available for high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the boot can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; his work , however , should be somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another motor@@ isation : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; the equipment in the top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City @-@ Emer@@ gency braking assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane support assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because at manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; are evaluated . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
&quot; however , full connectivity is available only for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI connector lie underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel engines are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of haz@@ ards that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have occurred anywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when paid the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , sick leave will only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without a doubt . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests are reported to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly had poll@@ uted the sea water . &quot;
the family thought that the trip had been inadequate and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
before court the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success .
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
&quot; however , the organisers only learned about it shortly before the pla@@ inti@@ ff &apos;s departure . &quot;
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus judgment . &quot;
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 kt .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , following the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be headed and decided at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and split . &quot;
we won &apos;t grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , this increases safety and also strengthens the consent of the people for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals up to the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit range over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the law of arms has been amended to make it difficult for the purchase of weapons on the internet . &quot;
the last much discussed silence of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is said to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to search for solutions how to reduce the risk of citizens , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister sees a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ishment of the double nationality previously .
&quot; as a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , it is constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ boss Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister to simulate action and capacity for action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist packages .
left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet testing and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway access feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every evening , when they travel via the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road building is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ er Straße , the right @-@ hand bending track by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then cycle directly from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic spl@@ its up early , thus improving the overall drain on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district &quot; &quot; Münster @-@ West &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers mostly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return leg reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h trail and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle height on the B 51 shortly before the De@@ par@@ ture Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided through the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations show that the bridge does not have the necessary load @-@ bearing capacity to absorb , above all , heavy @-@ load traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ daily stress will last , the competent national firm cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years have to be reck@@ oned : because the bridge has an official remainder of the remainder of the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state @-@ owned company consciously selected the traffic @-@ weaker period during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; of the young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from eleven to fifteen years attended the production in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; between September 2015 and March 2016 , most of the youths in the classroom were from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from language children , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should receive the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of the weather
the weather has made the star @-@ sni@@ pp@@ et @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a d@@ ash through the bill in the southwest of Germany on the night - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain , to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars per hour with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : advice against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around forever , at night , you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think about sleeping . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you are in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how can sleep problems or sleep disorders share ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , Board Member of the German Society for S@@ leep @-@ up and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands pro@@ vision@@ ally , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ation and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; just sleeping a lot of people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Lieb@@ knecht , member of the board of the German House of Internal Medicine with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
&quot; in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is most common in case of depression , &quot; she says . &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , We@@ ep gives an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I get to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised on the day , should go to the doctor , advises . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , low @-@ cost doctors do not exist in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ bra@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should contact your family doctor in case of sleep problems . &quot;
the doctor may investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , medical professionals recommend that snor@@ ing with respiratory sett@@ lers , in case of disease fatigue , sleep transm@@ it@@ ters or if you do not find the cause of a dor@@ man@@ t distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ replace explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; Fi@@ ba@@ o says . &quot;
&quot; after the disgu@@ sting , one goes to bed in his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera att@@ aches to the sleeping @-@ end on the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can put on a better sleep .
&quot; the process counts on : regular bed@@ time and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , alcohol , and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately and this is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a short@@ fall champi@@ onships and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his ex @-@ team colleagues via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets € 20,000 bonus and a jungle @-@ king of 150@@ ,000 € , no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming sport is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see as closely as dop@@ ing on the topic dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how it should be done with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A cannot take part , &quot; asks the election Hamburg , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : tape captured by Lu@@ ggage Li@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were able to arrest the Düsseldorf police . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage @-@ pil@@ es as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 hrs , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport received a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft victims . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July this year , and were involved in a common , firm , and particularly professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Police Office , 34 , can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves , which were specially commissioned for off@@ ences to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in total , they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few aven@@ ues of lime @-@ trees , and a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones in between : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t work like that , but the police are one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ et . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn off shortly , it is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , however , articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , are preferred to be bil@@ led with burning cars in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rented rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were evacu@@ ated , pat@@ rolling three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile the building workers were renov@@ ating the premises on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers retired from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents go for walks with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others chat early late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is raising three children here , are above all anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
they share the concerns of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication with the residents of the house projects .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z who predominantly wanted police protection from the hostile left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police open between home occup@@ ants and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police order in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the Riga were leg@@ alized and partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by inv@@ oked slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades thrown with paint bags .
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as physical injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the off@@ ences constitutes property damage , which tends to hit the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , cannot speak of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not sure . &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer in front of Riga anymore .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from one another than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn to Riga &apos;s road - and has remained .
&quot; for this reason it was also so important that people get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; they are actually con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well bed , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what can you do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for en@@ gen@@ ders who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who are moving should be aware of this - just as someone who walks into a pub district can complain about noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee child
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicates that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the egg @-@ cutting wool @-@ milk , which primarily has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of task areas desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , is an exciting wool @-@ cream sau . &quot;
&quot; although administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people , and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; Reg@@ ine says , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers are located in the &quot; &quot; Was@@ en@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for some time now , it has been a serious problem to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they have to put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the Commune and Job@@ centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , administration does not find private homes . &quot;
&quot; so far , it did not work so far , it was necessary to rely on private flats , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community apartments need to be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and emig@@ ration activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine says . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do non @-@ profit work - and that is motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so we need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , administration and volunteers are also going to jump here . &quot;
it is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes time to bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever evol@@ ves the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not want to work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority are motivated .
&quot; but there are problem cases too , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the latest incidents are afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine says clearly , &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins could kill them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they don &apos;t have anything to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine says . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region . &quot;
they have always in the background that a new impact on refugees and migrants is soon to come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we would like to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the authors are already busy trying to integrate the existing ones in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. on Friday morning .
the inhabit@@ ant surprised the two and struck the un@@ ob@@ sol@@ ete into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters in size , probably mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ Grey and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ls wore jeans . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
the police used several squ@@ ad@@ rons as well as a police helicopter .
the for@@ tification was without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell near the apartment or when they fled . &quot;
