<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, they drove home to the troughs in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he left with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even go for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports assistant handed over to the man from Anhausen under a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"silver bay leaf, champion-tour-player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already rebuked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been fostering young talent."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time American master winner was added to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the rider Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum the hand-baller Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company went to the show stadium, where the Lavazza price was running."</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump aims to keep in doubt small and warn against how the state of the economy can harm the economy, with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to beat the economy to death and regulate to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive regulations massively, and he is strongly committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes for the rich would be increased, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be no party-internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more prominent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and reboot coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas; he wants to announce the Paris Climate Protection Plan.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to specifically expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands:" a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in terms of infrastructure, even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazione trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both, however, want to not isolate the US from international trade, but rather to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be rattled, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics considered him, that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">"escape:" "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women are sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Director of Condrobs, a representative for social welfare services in Bavaria, and is dealing among other things with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralized shelters for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors either.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences on her flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hope carriers," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, moral murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who thinks that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and worst misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, appreciate it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not involuntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, more accommodation is needed only for them, asks Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Oberpfalz and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabians alone, fleeing women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are several communal houses or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing, men and women are housed together, it can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and accessible for women easily, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as the women feel the need for this protection, one can read the crowds it gives to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since he has spoken about that there is us, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second home.</seg>

<seg id="5">"in July, assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" persistently quiet "would have remained a problem, which led to the refusal of the treaty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Beyond"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter-player in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't forbid myself of the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin smiled smiles and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report, all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even bigger, since it was perpetrated by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousin again becomes difficult if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media held a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious accusations were allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his office on a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it looks at its reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued grudge over the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pike to take advantage of the cool sentiment and diminish Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state in Ankara won with certainty a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analyst once described to me," Alliance of outsiders ": two countries that feel driven by the West and are badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents spoke out at the press conference that they would not even have stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately delayed a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on how a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian struggle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least again."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been Vice President since 2012, was named his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the renowned National Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian), that he later served as the director and chief of staff of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment he said to Putin," "Thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding draft bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putins and works like him for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country as Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was touted as potential president suddenly wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached the power he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of office had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion investment project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "deck blower", "which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 different cast cables."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion investment project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, Minister Keith Brown reportedly paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of Decks gets a concrete casting for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the shutter represents future-proof high and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last street cover section and its connection with the northern tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap on the north or north side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sacred activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances to which the team worked were tiny, they were only a few millimetres on each side."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweig inexpensive apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">"in future, the SPD and the Greens mean: investors should be obliged much more in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next council meeting, the SPD proposes a" "concept of action". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation has been missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments, however, can also be found in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the main point in the town hall is, however, Bratmann:" how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but building as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, said Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make as few regulations as possible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of his, so Bratmann, there is a maturation of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how can we offset the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose fostering is going to expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, according to planned spokeswoman Nicole Palm, current ties from the city should now be purchased."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought about getting the apartments back into the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the west-city the end of the year's deadlines expire.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments one could get there back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: the owners, the housing companies do not want."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West is increased drastically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D Group president Holger Herlitschke comments:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"on the other hand, I have concentrated on more buildings for single-family homes."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenager and child no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been laughed by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially set to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created at first for videogames in the 1990s (a series of animations, playing cards and other spin-offs) were created later."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, interest was dropped before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players with their smartphones go outside and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and once they were found," photographed "(taken over a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation playing the game, when she was younger, joined the ahn and jumped for the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the" average "person refuted each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take" "30 minutes time" "to" "come from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day" "met deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people who look elappointing."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships at the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also cruelly toys that always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people to hunt active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast erklomm on Thursday for the title title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles on the Swedish bar during the solo campaign of women in gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title, and a total of the fifth, while she solidifies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success places them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"the last three years has dominated her sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"it was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-battle female of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Billy won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi."</seg>
<seg id="21">"although Biles insisted on having never planned the future, it is not true."</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">"this girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gymnasium in which Boorman exercised, became a force."</seg>
<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has no longer lost a competition competition, a winning series that will halt as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even though Mustafa led by two turns, the picture deceives."</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground dunes - in which Biles holds the world title - lautered.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15.433 on the floating beam - and then placed another on the floor with a 15.933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her softly as she expected her funeral - a pure formality - and tears poured on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team of men, called" Oma, "had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her floor exercise she threw out Kusshunt's audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, sometimes doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first mass murderous fall of Phoenix, were killed in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm as he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>

<seg id="10">"the river Comite close to Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are all likely to reach record levels throughout the weekend."</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the nearby Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these flows over the beaten rivers flow only slowly into Lake Maurepas."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level at 09.00 on Friday, which was ever recorded."</seg>

<seg id="15">"Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were saved by Gloster on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, has risen dramatically over night."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives near him would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we woke up and the water flowed and flocked in," "said Hansford."</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"his wife said Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she never saw such a high tide of the river."</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all the obstacles and he was the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glowe where they stayed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Krautmann said that the flood had spread rapidly, as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Krautmann, an observer reported in the vicinity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain."</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was considerably suctioned by rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classes in five boroughs.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine among women's olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kościan, the Catholicon is round off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterly gyms routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but so do gymnastics all over the country do not look like this."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all fought the same way as Aly and Madison to get into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympics will only have four gymnastics in the team."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turnes is an expensive sport and Turner primarily comes into private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to offer the municipalities aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible exercise training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnstiftung for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to the youth, who deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected him."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a" "Niemandsland" "and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first assistants should receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend placements, in order to improve the maintenance at unfavourable times."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA committee for assistant physicians, shared last night in a message:" "assistance physicians have serious concerns to the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors appropriately."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by the government struggled with the government for reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the raising and address the concerns of the assistants."</seg>
<seg id="10">"should he fail to do so, the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures."</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form layers.</seg>
<seg id="9">"when the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that caches the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness culture makes electoral fraud blooming in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to knowingly ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former member of the cabinet, Sir Eric Pickles, verbally attacks the police, elective observers and town halls to ignore the evidence of election abuses based on" "suspicion of ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and the Local Government, who is now an antagonist king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside electing cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should demonstrate their identity, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter just has to call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable ink on a person's finger, when they give up their vote to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial investment culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special arbitration court decided that the current mayor of Luton Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "cynically" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation when someone else chooses one.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarmingly in the fraudulent letter-election - in which the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to cleanse the electoral system, including conducting failure to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "as proof it is appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... governmental institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" sensitivities in terms of ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban that political activists manipulate postal voting records to stop" election harvesting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before you vote for your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on a person's finger, as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to be carried out to ensure that they are ineligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists process complete correspondence and envelopes of postal cuts.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police give the authority to set up barriers for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of the law facilitated by an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the People Act 1983 (People's Rights Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that staff rule out that voters go alone in the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlets there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral district has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty on the basis of the high requirements of the criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "checkpoints" of the voting registration departments of the City Council.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer to your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if one approaches you from behind, then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and go out of the line," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the gun between your front arm and shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with his knees in the bar and twist, while the attacker squeezes before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon against him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler dragged his immune system and thrombosis of a serious test - by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk snapped his train on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing head of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"prior to the leakage of each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to take."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea to lick off the rinsing head of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel, traveling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to dishwashers of toilets, the task assigned his immune system definitely among a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said," As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their luminous number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "That's coming close to the worst thing I've got in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more ridiculous than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D. in order to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorimaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our common environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film's direction, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, particularly with the well-being of gastric and intestines, and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria added."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social apartment after a delay of £50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treachcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocking employees of the housing cooperative found property in irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls pointed windows, wooden floors were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, disputes and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which might be demolished under certain circumstances, old trash was found."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogioned her and her partner forcefully from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogification was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't care for anybody. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, when they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, trash and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added," "It is a shame that tenants can agree to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since delogification is always the last step taken into account by Cornwall housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house management will now have to move away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as garages, parapheres and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon gained a fine after she had become guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial sight.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will deloge renters who do not obey the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">The police of Devon and Cornwall informed Angela Crow that the delogification was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not obey the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the bastion of the group in the country, reported ITV news on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she pretended to leave the land-torn country and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>

<seg id="2">"those who do not conform and Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases," says the president of the Gülen-near Stiftung Dialogue and Welt, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in short, the Kurdish community of Germany reckons with tens of thousands of protection-seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" several hundred thousand, "the chairperson Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh repression of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand protection-seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime further fights the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the chairperson Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already crossed short-term strongholds with sanctions a few months ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the vain coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state which absorbs refugees, produces refugees in their own country," "said Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Chief of Staff complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">That is why Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chief of the Association called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"also in Germany, a" witch-hunt "against Erdogan-critic is taking place."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last few months, I am no longer feeling safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a Gülen follower destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not adapt to and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and Säculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Gülen-close Stiftung Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seekers recognized by political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>
<seg id="22">"as of June 30, this has been 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all eligible candidates (39.625)."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for more than now it does not work: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the choice fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most holiday makers, who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no locals, so may not choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems arise: during the holidays there are helpers who hang posters, disperse air balloons, distribute flyers and count towards the end of the votes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"by September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass once again election campaigns to the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in polls clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"what is exciting is how much newcomer AfD is cutting off, and what remains in the end of coalitions dust."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, he sees from his major posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, spread roses and chatters a little with the people, just like his legendary foreword predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blooming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We create this" "hastened the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU, with its peak candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations twice; Merkel's Bundestag election circuit is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority from other federal states," "accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany once again to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely waives the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, according to Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"also the Union has noted that in the country, it crumbles the base that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is at stake, Sellering called his SPD in an especially committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the S & D Group lagged 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD was still clearly at 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the state day."</seg>
<seg id="32">"from vacation times, they make a modern virtue and relocate their campaign largely to the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "on-line campaign", "it calls the president Claudia Müller."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green electors go on a search for clues for local voters."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, currently curvates with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even nice."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and only end up at 20 o'clock, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at the beginning of the half-season, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the decision will also be vowed to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to furnishing accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blockage of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides again.</seg>
<seg id="11">The credential traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were sometimes significant complaints," "says the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the refurbishment of the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bachwaystraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneaks were seeking and rather familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were frantic.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not observed, the municipality also called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant transgressions," "says King, who made himself able to know himself about the situation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been heated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour at the pace-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has gone further, it has become calmer."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a rise in revenue, each one asks to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" "end customer", "so for other companies, the renovation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight decline," "but also admits that of course," "walking" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the bars along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, Steakhouse owner, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to release half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other country circles where such things have been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less frequently because of complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>

<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-klifts return after the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">"in spite of the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner is holding the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis he experienced in their long-standing history."</seg>

<seg id="24">Some of these are still unsettled and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, say de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it can't be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people worried about security."</seg>

<seg id="6">"despite the diesel affaires, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast a plus in spite of the diesel affaires, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets."</seg>

<seg id="9">"sales alone in Western Europe, the second most important market in China, were 14 percent below the previous year's month."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the home market Germany, deliveries declined by almost one sixth."</seg>
<seg id="11">Head of Sales Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the USA, where the exhaust-parapers first escalated, a minus can also be found."</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>

<seg id="17">Group sales Fred Kappler posted a sales increase from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Volkswagen made up 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retrofitting into the workshops."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance."</seg>
<seg id="23">"after retrofitting, the car manufacturer issued a" guaranteed "certificate, but does not speak of a" guarantee "as it was stated on Friday in company circles."</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason to be juridical intricacies.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the" Focus "had reported, Volkswagen is now offering its German customers a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this was confirmed last Monday, VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="27">"from the Ministry of Transport, it was confirmed that there was this meeting."</seg>
<seg id="28">VW has fulfilled the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA.</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations from this will not be accepted," declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine output will not take place after the conversion, and all type-approved vehicle values will remain unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Volkswagen itself uses the term" "warranty" "but not as it was called in corporate travel."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in the long term" warranty, "Volkswagen is able to see that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after retrofitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"also in customer interest, it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust fault, it comes to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before committing to the comment section, to look at it under the pseudonym NonAlleyn Men's middle-ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the re-emergence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely generation of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horror by hobbysers - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and grazing wild before I stand, hold my hands and say something better:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"art from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight men of middle-aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already value," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), revet the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and re-bought items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were somewhat too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets will apply to YouGov-Profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy again their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people generally discharged their collection in such a way around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of supporters of the record-revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers were offended by the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound record sleeves, from objects that evoke joyful adjustments."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector so and I think it is so for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff flees from a pile of piles."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I planed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-like, less musically classy."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the vinyl records almost a whole floor, has a pale audience than I am going in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts Newest Synthesize and sexstrapped pop instead of experimental jazz weaned from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but serious mental trauma is hard to determine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of sheets available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window shopping than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to be giving the appearance of muffling jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are looking for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter are thinking about buying a crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there's nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury goods such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov are right, they don't take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they do not spend their Thursday morning with the bumble through sheet shops of Berwick Street and the Sheets through Plates, while they avoid the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator looking at nothing of middle-aged men's shoulders above the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be fuelled by selling 72 temporary shops where people within the camp are selling goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, selling hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid, and which have a fire and health risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also explained that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" absolutely understandable. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp which is generally operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170.000 people have signed the petition, in order to preserve the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that" "closure" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two help organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants have estimated on Friday that the number of refugees living in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year-old Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the shape of the Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Teodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a master class in handling, side steppe, nightfall, line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medalist of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was won by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, a 15-man team would have been in best shape with this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago under Ryan they lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this hatch will hurt, but progress is astounding."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and blasted the attacks of GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau rushed out in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a tentative Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, the athlete jasa Veremalua went down a touchdown in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vbreatho Ravouvou squeezed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play 7, while the UK is still learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB led basic changes to half-time and closed the fijiian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant Interplay from Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South seeinsulans, whose fans swung, flags swung and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame translated the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked smashed in the turf."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in the past, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch of the race - Britain's conversion of the difference."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown took the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the British 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotinal gold as with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 tough guys who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiad in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who laid on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, at least their 39th impending deployment, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans that do not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one but the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day."</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risking.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it is spreading everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that is the correct term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing is a challenge, but it makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a more nerve-richer morning talking about something more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was a Captain at the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to be a trainee or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose any race during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to make some Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"next week Glover has to appear on a wedding, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic Champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - flashback for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition at the existing plants for the so-called self-flow production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers, the gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption, to register."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry rose additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent will fall."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this also does not rise in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as a result, the status quo is largely enshrined in the previous regulation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort by Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" "steel is future" "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of the issue of emissions, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation further aggravated when the world's largest producer country China threw steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel impact, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">"how sustainable is the price pickup, is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been more stagnant again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to close the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel manufacturers are careful despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the German economic association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the amount recovered now went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">"thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in output in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does good seniors well"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, at the Magisterium studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler states from the German seniors division."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often dissolve in old age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly request their lungs get out of the box as quickly as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of seniors."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people who suffer from dementia suffer from long-coming events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, a special achievement is required to the head, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, practice so, not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I practise for something long, I will better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a note goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"if you are looking for a suitable offer, Senior Citizens will have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many orderly choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, be sure to join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="11">They were played for a litle of little ones who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screaming of more powerful kittens, which were additionally raised."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who haven't yet had their own offspring, reacted to the screams," Konerding said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"they turned faster to the loudspeaker, when this calls of the very excited kitten played."</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bombastic isolated separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to restricted areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>

<seg id="2">"not always, the Olympics or World Records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia so slowly swam so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently converted to viral Internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended his trial with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sportive figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first top names made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called it the "robel of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the English tabloid" "The Sun" "inspired him with" Dad Bod. ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussesambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool in Aquatorial Guinea, when he had to compete on his own in a run of over 100 metres of Liberty style."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetic, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before the Olympic and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"as of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic meter of wastewater will amount to 2.10 euros instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2,18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an overly calculation, the wastewater fee in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget, Kulmbach, the District Office of Kulmbach, found that undercoverings have been under cover for these sewage systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost-covering basis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultoberg will have to go deeper into the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as head of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt showed up, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the preceding calculation period will also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt founded the severe fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small, with a very low waste water waste, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the recumbent calculation period of all three plants, renovation and repair expenditures fell in a considerable scope, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that in the sewage system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced as a result of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be evacuated, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "for these extraordinary expenses the continued support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were substantially below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the course of the low waste water in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully smashed.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt added that the market community of large entertainment costs remained spared during the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious, especially since the supply area of the waste water association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended because these facilities are deficient facilities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, it allows a snapshot of around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurde."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unflowered, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All malfunctions go public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, the Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past where they were accused of promoting black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellowish face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters rather than caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Savapani, a Korean-American student of art whose tweet was widely spread across the photos, was that the filter was" hurtful and mild. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow-face was pulled into the dropping extremity."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural mile.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And snapchats large audience of young people - who are more different in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting to a user," it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that rapid-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticised the big part white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat mostly left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, the company leaned to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a personnel officer focused on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu also said she will leave her Snapchat account and added," I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, rejects Congress Committee"</seg>
<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence official information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground, reported a report of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Army Committee, Intelligence and Military Intelligence reports, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering intelligence, typically attracted by high-ranking Centcom commanders, posted a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground, and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the ten-page report presents detailed, persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces."</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, Centcom has publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command tops changed the intelligence reports to play the risk of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of Centcom reports are being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the High Level Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "damaged the morale amongst analysts and" gave excessive amount of room for dissenting opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's Inspector, who was taken up after complaints from Centcom's analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports, while the investigations of the general inspector were still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful aerial campaign conducted under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, allegations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism regarding the secret formations of the Islamic State is reminiscent of the disputes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush showed only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker denies government agencies that contrary to the statements of the government airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centres damaliger Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are at the first place in their group with the Britons who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always, the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team, began to turn things into a better way."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work place in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely ripped the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a backlash from the local area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," "said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of next game on Saturday."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a frenzied relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow archers to the swimmers to the triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time through sponsors and well-being TV ads when he was a swimmers, gymnast or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not immediately illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make some modest arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many people, I had asked, didn't know that it was an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete, who made it to the final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ears for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending bouncing - but also the grace of gymnastics and scuba diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampolines, which means" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to move a number of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to version, level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallions hoping to go further up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further underpinned goal in TV transmissions: the world or the Olympic Record."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator into tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she is bouncing off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, moves upwards, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant annulment of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition in the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympic mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objective of male athletes - as the male American Turner recently proposed to The Wall Street Journal, then Mr. Dooley anticipates his air rinse, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators, demanding political changes in Ethiopia, met the government's violent resistance."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more regions."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and asked fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was not relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed on tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa's project manager of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads tend to be quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and do not have any other options out of protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Tesla, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use up to the stranglehold regarding the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-sighted vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Ogaden Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which have been forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of noise.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and improve Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were so protests gathered.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amhas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amhas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amhas, who from Ethiopia are predominantly Christian high-countries, prospered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amhas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairbly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigers who account for about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublicized disease in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, when thousands were protesting against elections, which, according to analysts, apparently passed away from the government and were subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest relatively quickly passed."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievances of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amresian city, attacked by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently confirmed that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump was trying to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who try to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to declare statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made reference to an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump threw back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweets on Friday Mr. Trump said he was sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the charge was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt asked Mr. Trump to weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism bounces down to Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign for falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump was trying to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump already presented sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself as he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs Clinton's emails, but he later declared" "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits of politics and then to rude back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his assertions vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump accepted an estimated sound as his cargo values went further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to not apologise for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while emphasizing the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's assertion whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind legs, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in the Clinton neighborhood, served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"prior to the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump was continuing his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who tried to understand him and said," You can't! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats complained about Mr. Trumps apology as only another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="4">"soap Cherie's business, replacing Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes."</seg>
<seg id="5">Indigenous people seized it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter," I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempted and Verb is now a soap business. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"but if New York is changing, it is also a re-invention."</seg>
<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time associate of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new external source, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnities such as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are signs of nature.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez told him that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed by prizes from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even after having moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road."</seg>
<seg id="27">"after the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drinking a while, she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="29">"now they drink coffee again, even if they ordered a Blended Chai tea instead of their usual iced coffee, which is another new addition."</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the beginning of the Verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer."</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">"nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese."</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no grudge over the fact that the soap business took the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap to brew the coffee in the coffee shop as an ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will still deal with her offer," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">"and the traditional Polish people, greenpoints, have also accepted the café."</seg>
<seg id="39">"a new customer translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he proposed to put them out soon, so that his new neighbors will feel welcome."</seg>
<seg id="40">The site also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a passion for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Brickman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COes last book" "Chop Suey" "acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "published on Tuesday in Harper Publishing, illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they show culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, caressed snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato purée and vegetable mix ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter ordered minced meat, this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "Brickman said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap to stretch the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Coe grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have placed itself in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served fresh baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways in which the country has moved around, no longer to be the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense theme," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods, such as breads and brasseroles, became staple foods, the casserolle as a" "wonderful way of reassuring food residues", "when cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely served luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"odd mixtures were tried out, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at lunchtime," "says Coe."</seg>
<seg id="29">"brickmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the domestic recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - promoted the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "housekeeping" "and the challenge to turn pamphlets like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-myself-cake-food-attitude, are tasty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hairs usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 meters far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this longevity based lifestyle seems to be a patronage for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" Science "in any case from a Greenland-shark, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity, Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock comments this life span, which for vertebrates means a world record."</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist suspected long ago, Greenland's hair was stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are hard to watch, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated shores of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-up tempo was, as they found six animals in front of Spitsbergen with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver which torches from higher water-layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-sharks that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lentil core of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were notably carbon-14 in the lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"her birth, therefore, should be after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons tests carried out large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, with 220 centimeters of length of the third smallest animal, on the other hand, the lenticular nucleus withstands a slight surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lentil core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long grass-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters would be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-female only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of length could assign an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such Methusalema live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly big."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal absorbs heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">"as a result, the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Department of Excellence Financial Markets and IW's real estate markets. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether monetary homes continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for the so-called EU passport, it has already been granted approval in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="6">That is why we are using just large US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced that jobs should be stored.</seg>

<seg id="10">"in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer. "</seg>

<seg id="16">"in addition, the rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch-St. Anna's pastoral care unit were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were accomplished."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time as far as the next Romanesque pilgrimage of all mints in the period of two years, the Upper ministerial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a long-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where, during this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the opened portal of mercy on Freiburg Münster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruene, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms made their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Rev. Stores sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and distributed the Pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb he was driven by rail to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Muenster Our Lady stands, and thus the pilgrimage route from Münster was started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse in the morning and evening, with different prayers, songs and texts."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the notch that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the Jump and legend hauled the legend when he stormed home to make a victory of the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as Hinds.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in which they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner won an olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his turn, Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation that drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell in Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It is a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make myself a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys side there were indications that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said:" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kennys, it is possible in the field of the possibility that he will win Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28 year old from Bolton said," I just enjoy this for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"saying," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-odometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought yesterday with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background Dramas played in the background, leaving the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing issues, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary call GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operators announce the energy supply contract and thereby lift all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the plant's operation."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could lead to domino effect, as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the overall electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the meltdown of Alcoa in Portland loses money, risking a closure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculations concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL believes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL further said that the contracts were so-called" hedging transactions, "which would have come into effect in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the earnings of AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to run the melt or to ensure the supply to melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into force from November this year, even if there is still a question of why it has withdrawn from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are warning of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and Tomago to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems were to disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in the demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché-coated plot nearly every birthday episode of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence" "You thought we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris has had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians started."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her beating the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>

<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she finds herself in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people from today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video (even though it all applies to Jenner).</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator came on the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, and this would suffice for roughly two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came to businesses exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as the "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also via fax was the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, although slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story even though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the market is dominating vendors that all came much later than Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="25">"ever and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"about 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units alone."</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction in Heathrows, just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions were benefiting from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities we will create 10,000 new teaching positions alone, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blamend on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of witty growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the heart of the two most frequented catwalk of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to supply a third running steg, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook told us that his desktopside would change the coding related to his advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect the indication of what part of the site is advertising."</seg>

<seg id="3">The police witnesses witnesses after a woman was convicted in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay down in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman, at the age of 49 who was driven by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on site.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said, asking them and every witness of the incident to sign up."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared with Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases, in which a person ran in the dark on the highway, it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian flows in the middle of the night on the motorway, as it was called in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after passing a man and killed one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly shifted."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the gradual turn of the Venus exponents its daytime side of the Sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rains creating a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of the Venus that resembles evolution previously assumed by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"when their hydrogen withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus, which as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data will help astronomers understand why stars in star cluster rotate to different rates, and in what context the rotational periods can be associated with planet creation."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancers, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now rotating the fastest way.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotation rates, these mature stars collide large amounts of star winches."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger star pirouettes faster than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently attacking companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware Defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware replacement."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes adversely on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, potentially lethal ransom is significantly higher than in private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently witnessing an alarming rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months swiftly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin cryptogenesis."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, firms are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a Ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German firms affected lost revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims:" don't pay, you only support the problem, "says Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in view of standstill in operation, it is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have investigated the user areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims by chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, establish freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private persons are redeemed according to payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively high-risk profits from the ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, safety expert Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the criminals then instruct spammers with spreading," "declares Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is well-known for many companies that better secure their data."</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaustion, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing policies," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could also take up completely new targets on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerconference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat that was connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heater might be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it does not work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit surface drops off."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a trunk of 453 l available for high-up and 1026 l with inverted back rests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the boot can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"his work, however, should be somewhat quieter."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorisation: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the equipment in the top variant" "Executive" "leaves nothing to be desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the security systems include the City-Emergency braking assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warning sometimes irritates, because at manoeuvring many obstacles as" "approaching objects" "are evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, full connectivity is available only for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI connector lie underneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel engines are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal remedy is to be extended.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around forever, at night, you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think about sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you are in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disorders share?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, Board Member of the German Society for Sleep-up and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands provisionally, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inhalation and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just sleeping a lot of people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Liebknecht, member of the board of the German House of Internal Medicine with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medicines are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">"infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is most common in case of depression," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, Weep gives an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I get to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised on the day, should go to the doctor, advises."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, low-cost doctors do not exist in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fibraetze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, you should contact your family doctor in case of sleep problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">The doctor may investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the case of snoring with respiratory problems, medical professionals recommend that snoring with respiratory settlers, in case of disease fatigue, sleep transmitters or if you do not find the cause of a dormant disturbance, Fireplace explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," Fibao says. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the disgusting, one goes to bed in his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera attaches to the sleeping-end on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can put on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the process counts on: regular bedtime and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, alcohol, and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately and this is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few avenues of lime-trees, and a rest of cobblestones in between: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't work like that, but the police are one of the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"when one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolet."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the façade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in contrast to a Lidl, which is to be torn off shortly, it is already built: by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, however, articles about this" trendy district, "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred to be billed with burning cars in the past few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rented rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly argued for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-Go Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were evacuated, patrolling three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile the building workers were renovating the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers retired from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents go for walks with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chat early late."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are above all annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the concerns of rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez who predominantly wanted police protection from the hostile left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between home occupants and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police order in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by invoked slices or freshly painted facades thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "left autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as physical injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most important part of the offences constitutes property damage, which tends to hit the newly built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94, cannot speak of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not sure."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer in front of Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here, one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from one another than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to Riga's road - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason it was also so important that people get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"however, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"they are actually condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well bed," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for engenders who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who are moving should be aware of this - just as someone who walks into a pub district can complain about noise.</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine Customer of the working group indicates that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-cutting wool-milk, which primarily has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of task areas desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, is an exciting wool-cream sau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"although administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle writes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people, and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," Regine says, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new containers are located in the" "Wasenstraße" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time now, it has been a serious problem to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, administration does not find private homes."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it did not work so far, it was necessary to rely on private flats, according to Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, community apartments need to be infamous as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be placed in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and emigration activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or established."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine says. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so we need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, administration and volunteers are also going to jump here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it takes time to bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever evolves the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, do not want to work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problem cases too, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the latest incidents are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine says clearly, "what some people may call naive." a residual risk could and would not exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins could kill them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they don't have anything to do with it," Regine says. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new impact on refugees and migrants is soon to come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we would like to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the authors are already busy trying to integrate the existing ones in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
