Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and proposes Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , but a meeting had refused this election in Israel with regard to the time im@@ minent . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend has shot dead &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; cute dog &quot; but still live and was probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was ca@@ str@@ ated on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had been in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already had 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ak@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb has made the disa@@ strous emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motivated by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions which Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight out of the campus police found Lam@@ bs lane later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb opened his work at the University in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he did his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game . &quot;
at that time he was the flock of women .
&quot; all the girls ch@@ ased away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb had ended his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica end before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service . &quot;
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vi@@ gil during the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workforce for the holiday season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas seasonal employees like last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it would plan to put 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , increasing the number of employees from October to December . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip the shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox swe@@ ats over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated G@@ äh@@ nen and an arm @-@ length away from being with the Princess of Wales for a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief reiter@@ ates all parties , including the split UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the meeting of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
he called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some tried to brand him up as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and starting to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa made last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week pol@@ l said 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , they would either be &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
only two out of ten say they were &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not go to the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their hats , Republi@@ can voters stop Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp was the best bet . &quot;
this is a change from the time when four out of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P voters look at Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
&quot; but a pol@@ l from the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina he has 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new pol@@ l from C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have given up their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp on the issue of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point was in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp will apparently do it . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l conducted by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential districts of Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ art Trail is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a roof roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; i.e. the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in what particular situations , one square meter is the most cost . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros ni@@ x - per square meter , well @-@ noted . &quot;
but well who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top right here .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double pe@@ at in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller from the FC Bayern paved the way to a earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a confident start of the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given a dream start to FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ re@@ aus in Milan .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ fri@@ lls ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth grid success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; Müller received the prize in the Champions League at the Champions League for the Bayern @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ sten Roberto , who made a f@@ uss of the Grand Master as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm was promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his recent six home games in the premi@@ er class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their aggressive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were initiated too often by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely penet@@ rated against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first of all , Olympic Games Stur@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown hit the Polish Head@@ ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct measure , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ted with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavarian raised her usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could set needle stit@@ ch . &quot;
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; for example , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had defended a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was initially sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light only after gradu@@ ation , said Dr. Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still made one . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partially twisted Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with striking clas@@ hes against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : in doing so , the risk drops rapidly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international team of researchers , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 @-@ barrel . &quot;
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes of tooth loss are cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the danger came back to the level of non@@ smo@@ kers , explained Thomas Dietrich of the British University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; explained Master H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to good dental health to high age according to our findings .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of unemployment has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet lef@@ to@@ vers from Cologne on the Rhine river on rem@@ nants of the late antique
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always being moved as a specialist office for archaeological soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction phase of the bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman has died at the station at the station of the Gei@@ distra@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern station , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by collecting the train , she suffered severe injuries , according to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance forces .
about the reason of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the medi@@ ating officials .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by of Lin@@ der@@ ner rail , tiled bak@@ ers , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;
&quot; information about the cause of the accident can be given under the phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ ,000 or any other police station under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ ,000 or any other police service . &quot;
European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in its operation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; declared commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the show . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone will be created with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US are jointly choosing independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with one another to arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work towards an International Investment Appe@@ al in accordance with its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the Investor @-@ State Dis@@ pu@@ te Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) especially demanded by large corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , through which companies can manage damages on tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first draft opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals by the European Commission to be insufficient . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German Secretary of State , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans as big progress . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission considered essential points that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association business Europe warned against limiting the economic possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by it .
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , there should be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to him , there is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the in@@ timi@@ dating folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost grab@@ bed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells about various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they arose and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; with 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , seem to drift into great opul@@ ent moments . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .

&quot; one year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a sophisticated masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic selling pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but staged by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs have desc@@ ended , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle from Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is a member of a band of five headed by Germany .

&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs now , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk music . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; &quot; plate basically &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Debut in the Ques@@ tion of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s dé@@ but will be eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ zier &apos;s Fra@@ cture . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his dé@@ but to the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ zier and join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre @-@ determined questions shortly after lunch where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence on Tuesday provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several titles pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he was &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he suggested to the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in economics , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported it as a leader . &quot;
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; within Labour &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ zier is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he has both &quot; kno@@ ck @-@ out &quot; and stri@@ pping with det@@ ain@@ ees , instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the Shadow economy minister , if he does not take part - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ zier . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it . &quot;
&quot; as she was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary groups , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms . &quot;

pound asc@@ ends through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound sli@@ pped according to data , which had an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid for SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and yiel@@ ded assessments of the time of an interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after take @-@ over offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
&quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures strike all expectations , and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - is back growth . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion dollars by a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports clothing company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin

&quot; b@@ lower 21 years young , a hand@@ ing with an over@@ lap frame . &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
more even more .
currently Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the Generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name of &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the building of the Bie@@ ber : here you live i@@ dol , whose posters hang up in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the Suite , where the Canadian singer is living , costs exactly as much on the day as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if at all .
&quot; she says : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I will fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bie@@ ber does not .
it has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertisement in the promotional break of the Super@@ visor , he collected three million dollars , one two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company r@@ ins@@ ed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with each doll , which looks like he and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects . &quot;
&quot; if J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the wind@@ screen . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally right in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to No. 1 .
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato @-@ t@@ int @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both are both - in the Pot@@ ato D@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg pupp@@ y owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the word &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration titled &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen on television by chance . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi@@ cul@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea of the Lebanese has meanwhile been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ cash ki@@ cks off constant campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - collapse
met@@ amor@@ us tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ a has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di &apos;s opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their ties with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A traders and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investor strategy ag . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA @-@ stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , however , believe that Al@@ di will cut off about five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all the existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and amounts of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ a will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ a declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ a has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in simultaneous print on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers are fighting and investing more than 150 million dollars to synchron@@ ize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products each week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and load remedi@@ ation programs at El@@ an are going to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , earning more praise than criticism for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious contest of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery skill game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison shou@@ ted : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kr@@ amp@@ f defeated a potential US Open Vic@@ tory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gra@@ oth at the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite excited about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account C@@ yrene at the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; C@@ yrene &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares disaster , closes the border , stops refugees &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants trapped in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built up tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the Mig@@ rants &quot; Op@@ ens the B@@ order ! &quot; and scre@@ ams insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police forces . &quot;
some referred back to protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants returned from Hungary , while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution rather than a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the corrupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would have reached that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency standing on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ mates were deployed at the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck in the Middle East for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen days for days at the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of the off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , following a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos revers@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to in@@ ject themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in coming in , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
&quot; the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) , while S@@ anders ranked second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; her support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit in democratic voters aged 50 and over has been forced to flee , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big margin in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters in the presidential elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters in the early elections say that they support Clinton , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the notion that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned Bill Clinton &apos;s connection ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the Vice President hur@@ ts potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters will be asked by the preliminary elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clinton &apos;s supporters , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead tends to rise above S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , there is not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important features of vot@@ er choices for their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ds consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is the best in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server be continued as an external minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters in the previous elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now unhappy with their declaration , whereas only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters consider Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp received good scores , however . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the failure rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l has now dropped , and others dramatically lose their grip . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida governor , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son raises in the surveys - he lands at 19 % support for Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent pol@@ l conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp well ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a look at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even hot water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic Sea , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a single @-@ channel ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mo@@ or@@ ings were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle their symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and set the common welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died next morning to his injuries .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated repeatedly with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died on the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for Mor@@ des third degree for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for malicious attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
&quot; an increase in tari@@ ffs is coming , and the home@@ se will get stag@@ gering , loans for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only little guidance for the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather for the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency of net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the findings of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , chief system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often support them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product , near its lowest point , will be at an interest increase of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP has only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and pose the question &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants held a interest in F@@ ed &apos;s interest all year , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee &apos;s meeting this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading would only increase 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all creation cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ hol@@ dings were placed very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; firm income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that bonds are faster than stocks if they change their strategic course .
&quot; when bor@@ rowing , the returns appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to more conver@@ gence between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate despite &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit tension has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large @-@ scale businesses , which un@@ wind the greater part of their business activities in the US , will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will be po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; firms with strong balance sheet sur@@ passed companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers are able to see gains through higher yields , even if experts differ how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham , Member of Parliament &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; du@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 turns &quot; into Classic FM , &quot; asser@@ ts a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differ from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 would be far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn anything else about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I really consider important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work must be done to engage the audience , as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated € 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; , &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to fill in the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday may be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
in the last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed down expenses in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G Sales De@@ e to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when shop@@ pers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is going on , and we may experience that the growth is less@@ ening . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the following sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers keep their purchases back before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers shar@@ per their computers in order to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe Black Friday , where the buyer fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from doing shopping . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 expenditure was spent slightly more than 1 £ online .
&quot; for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group to the burden
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ z@@ ee .
&quot; gri@@ eving , largely dressed in white , the way to pay tribute , when the first of the dead started their last journey to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed through the sacred site , where only days before a building crane was over@@ thrown by the roof of the mosque and then on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 operators , who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to assist the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ling to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when he was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree published by the state @-@ owned Saudi press agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was forbidden to travel abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month . &quot;
the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree did not rebu@@ ke the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes en@@ close Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , the bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family during the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injury . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
&quot; this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people , are opened . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher offers 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that British put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen , who carry out work in their homes . &quot;
&quot; if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to conduct home jobs in their homes , says the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are hit by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , with more female single households having more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we need to post@@ p@@ one this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed leading company , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group failed to cut costs for closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
&quot; on Wednesday , in Kla@@ gen@@ furt , two officials from the Austrian volleyball team champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob were responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of office .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted in force in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the general prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defend@@ ants had funds from club accounts , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; with around 400@@ ,000 Euros , he deals with the damage . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact eliminated the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time was the association an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports business only accounted for damage compensation and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money , from debt brought out - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or stop the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read profession of the large @-@ scale audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , with appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance of expenses was decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance was paid off only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore also l@@ ump and not detailed book@@ ings appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts administered the two defend@@ ants , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial investment , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , as a result of official mis@@ use in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that had been set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room . &quot;
&quot; the accused had been informed , justified the function@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never paid a cent salary , he only paid o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; on diets , he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the accused were not able to present detailed documents for the early years .
&quot; they were not kept in store after an operating test , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the assignments were made in cash , in order to do so , he explained in his statement from his home town of international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard covers another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the personnel reduction , which has been running for more than three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the Stell@@ is@@ ors at the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US Technology Group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amounting to $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the breaking down of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ share gave 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the large @-@ scale group from California Pal@@ o Alto is currently expanding : in this way , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a renewed dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer in the after@@ math .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , shipments of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; in this way , revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive reductions on changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans provide a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly be rejected : 54 per cent said on the other hand , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
61 percent positive for other countries to fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad covers 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , 20 percent would be for this . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility will be at the heart of the fair . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility connects &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the broad public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the promot@@ ers of the V@@ DA association reck@@ on with about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; the Hungarian police have deployed several hundred indigenous refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water @-@ thro@@ wer . &quot;
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind the police , a police line was formed and a water @-@ thro@@ wer was standing behind the polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to officials . &quot;
the officials first started to spray pe@@ pper@@ mint .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees sack@@ ed and suffered under respiratory distress .
the press secretary of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is watching if the U.S. staff comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists inter@@ ro@@ gated by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view , was that the F@@ ed will continue to do so , now think that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and will keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior associate at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rugged outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
death Ar@@ ms at the Delta State University Le@@ ave ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
and he said he was shot at someone and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency telephone centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; is in the house , but who will &quot; &quot; distur@@ b no one &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb did not give explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said Lamb has called &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen picked him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , escaped on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a doctorate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the workplace . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and valu@@ ing Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in future , the management board headed by chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120@@ ,000 associates was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the airline Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict of the collective agreement with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike has stopped . &quot;
that was what the union divided .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement plan for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; cockpit wool &quot; wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa Cargo has moved to the Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings . &quot;
under the title &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; there are paintings by Le@@ ena Kr@@ ü@@ ger in the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double Fra@@ k@@ tur
&quot; during the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this brings the left outer defender to the crying and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double ra@@ cket and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated on in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very heavy and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
&quot; in this context , Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the England Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction so that it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you know it almost mem@@ ori@@ ously . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the Super@@ camp company and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read to my children , as it always seems like a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything is nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , returns an ingredient of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by reading their desire to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; as if that was not suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the lau@@ rel film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ ought frustr@@ ating Once @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons &apos; staff , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly under threat from the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der , which England has chosen for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series failure on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a forward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting arrangement , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th retired from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ und praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is mainly a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was ninth .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and reverse .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist .
&quot; he is an X factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he finished 2@@ 36 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very well . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to leave mos@@ ques beside cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four squ@@ e@@ aks emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
&quot; he made three hundred of us immediately , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;
&quot; team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you need to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .

foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at once said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises as the EU is now , and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they often do not want to be full . &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win alliances for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants an outside Britain outside the EU tent , &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and civil servants have come to the point in some capitals , whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel , pru@@ dent Chancellor Angela Merkel , is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened with the exc@@ essively long exhau@@ sting such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a burning force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will get a leg out to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan useful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can weak@@ en Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; in all his cra@@ ft@@ iness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones foreigners and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ lands , most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ ms , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly flap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ ies , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I think it is friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ ban tendency and the wild followers of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the sales campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins definitely thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin have political capital wasted - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be fu@@ tile ?
&quot; the US is already pretty disappointed with weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , included Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
P@@ he published the &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; building on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they received funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to obtain according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the Group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of most products for most of the criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the P@@ he claims that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said the broadcast fee should be used only to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for public @-@ legal programs , probably seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ con@@ ten@@ tious time windows to place against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to come into contact with the BBC for six years in Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I consider not to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that do not make or order . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed that could be financed even without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I try to see how this public @-@ ri@@ ghtful television should be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s blame for hunting for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programs give this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion Swiss broad@@ cast@@ ers , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value of it . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are £ 150 for a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s right because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check out , form and enter@@ tain its Eth@@ ics mission . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada , to inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of part@@ n@@ ering , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on TV , and enter alliances with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the method of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms generally do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then enter into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the lit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they belong to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when using ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the tru@@ ce fair - through a Le@@ ast of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid .
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ rint with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely alar@@ ming .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ana , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honest &quot; Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal appointments , but they are also the places where people dress and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted is a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos tap : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have you baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of mil@@ let for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added their milk a pur@@ ge to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the word you belong to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it was something for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded to this with even more lu@@ cr@@ ative music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two hours before leaving her own music , closing her door and going to her three hour examination . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come to the same student residence random@@ ly ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you are holding a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , going to her , to separate herself and then see her every day , and perhaps witness how she passes all common friends to himself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow @-@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your lower abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has let his keys lie in his un@@ locked room , the border between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments to become a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but don &apos;t ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but do not t@@ ack its possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , barley @-@ ear@@ ers &quot;
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the poor servant . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and good work today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are being forced into the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds on a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great deal here .
&quot; given the stream of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when you put people in blocks of living .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have passed my project correctly .
especially complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking space ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still subordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants respond to their terra@@ ced home project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury bodies for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : over the last five years , we had a construction boom in Germany , but built up luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean creating apps to create space - but Apple has made this impro@@ b@@ able by merging the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone may turn off half way and lead to a demo@@ lition of the update . &quot;

&quot; you should also make sure that you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things before your download to prevent things going wrong and protect yourself if you do it . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much smar@@ ter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system . &quot;
Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before starting in the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup second pointed out that I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve current races so far , and won the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city @-@ state as the favorite . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the present smo@@ g in the city state will have an impact on Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .
&quot; for days , a vap@@ our bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess player and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the sponsor of the 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that Chairman Alfred Klein met .
it is possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ s office seeks direct contact
&quot; both Sal@@ u@@ dis and the geri@@ atric centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft joined together under the coat of the social foundation , and opened a new start point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new qu@@ arti@@ s office was recently opened there .
&quot; right next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information on issues such as nursing insurance or health care services . &quot;
&quot; for years now , we have been working with our ambul@@ atory care service that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infinite number of questions .
&quot; the new land@@ lady Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; , &quot; is not rarely used . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training , or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre is seen by both business leaders in particular demographic change .
this is because it is a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ s office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club @-@ meeting : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular soci@@ able attendance . &quot;
the Social Foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible .
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

&quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon he ran out of the business , insul@@ ted the officials , and accused her of the fine capital punishment in front of the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reports . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow is displayed or not .

men beating up on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses sought the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 pm , three young men were on their way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , following information from the police followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to be waiting for him . &quot;
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the gas station area .
one of these men cried out to the young people and hit the face with their fist .
the victim suffered a mu@@ zzle of the nose and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to the apartment and left there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; by using a head@@ board , one checked on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
&quot; so far , there is only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and critics to report themselves under the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gil@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
&quot; furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing halfway through his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12th , until then , he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the rock @-@ standing years ago Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gil@@ l , who is currently undergoing her medical training at the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ breaks and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot;
&quot; the Müller @-@ couple liked the idea , in the future , to run their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so one agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief not@@ ary in Di@@ ep@@ holz and engaged in an honorary position in DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a GP , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home dentists . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gil@@ l . &quot;
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EK@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; at a subsi@@ dy of € 50@@ 000 , the Müll@@ ers receive a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises the general practitioner Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ z@@ l , about 2000 patients enter into the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor could have found himself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; whoever visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk hour , by the way , still looks at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialties and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen recalls . &quot;
they feel a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still very often , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband concludes : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels willingly . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also crossed at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum can do so &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia proves &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - denied Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians want to limit its borders to refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police managed to pick them up in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police cars in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik have been meeting new refugees ever since . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
&quot; in the coming days , his country is counting 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to encourage people to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police have told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the previously predicted postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west stretch . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm at a local eye in Hor@@ gos on Wednesday : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
there would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
&quot; one cannot say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still un@@ cleared mine fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock market h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million

&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;

&quot; while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously take up the chal@@ k and read the sentence &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;

&quot; however , that not everyone wanted to inform themselves publicly on the tablets , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result bl@@ ended and financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the Gi@@ ant Gi@@ ant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces Ear@@ nings Bet@@ ween 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in fiscal year ending in May 20 c@@ ents less than previous forecast .
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set to be 10,@@ 84 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases that amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and effective January 4 , and despite higher allow@@ ances for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than the rival of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ ack Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s analysts forecast € 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which generated sales in its unit Express shipment . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ pending against them at one end of the two @-@ story meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from an unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently were inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts turn the blow away by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would cancel the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow worsen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ elle had said in spring and early summer that , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed has seen as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now around 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what effects will be on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world &apos;s largest currency . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also provide advice with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ action on financial markets , which apparently is not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ner , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who is campaig@@ ning for interest in interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one year later , F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not coming close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a tax increase because the markets are upset , &quot; P@@ osen said , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is commonly referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / stock is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried products , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car division if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; if all the shopping you make hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the g@@ ark@@ et ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the till@@ s and has different taking options .
what is there ? do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat the@@ ke is extensive , as does the fish bar - the staff behind the bar will clean and filter the fish and fry them on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing compartment . here you will find frozen leaves , bitter mel@@ on and g@@ alle@@ gan@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef @-@ blood and g@@ all , pigs @-@ natural dar , fish balls , regional saus@@ ages , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide hall@@ ways are suitable for trol@@ leys and for@@ klift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own park area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of innumerable volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher of body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 talents .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of this is different than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pap@@ al Organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the € 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn of gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent meeting of the congregation , the elaborate construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the committee had decided , among other things , an application for a legislative &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; , &quot; it was a permit for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centre first and roof top &quot; should be constructed . &quot;
&quot; background planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; it was again about the a@@ version of the roof , which is supposed to lie under ten degrees for energetic reasons - other than in the development plan . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan on the a@@ eg@@ ro@@ e was not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ese municipal council usually rather restric@@ tive in the case of eman@@ cipation . &quot;
&quot; however , the &quot; &quot; Turn@@ halle &quot; &quot; project is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the Turn@@ h@@ h@@ bau at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the same time , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ land transport .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the Regional Council for the review . &quot;
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned , namely 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of Sch@@ ong@@ au Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the management from 1 October , came to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the District Court had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors according to which the House , which is owned by the Federal Republic of Germany , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what I conclude . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted that there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a day@@ care sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; explains Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; positive and very intel@@ li@@ gible &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in recent decades , the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the cultivation on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were used , as the police shared . &quot;
after a firing a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was unclear at first . &quot;
the police force was established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youths were killed and their corp@@ ses thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police don@@ ate on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , another 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening , who was in fact informed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the corp@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; during surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the corp@@ se was found .
&quot; the detention was reported to the authorities in police inter@@ rog@@ ation , killing the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and putting the corp@@ se into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the dock on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a charge on him . &quot;
the investigation of the closer circumstances of the act shall bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing pressures
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Development &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; with this , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many come across the apartment market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were hired for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also has significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing for an apartment deficit that will grow from year to year .
&quot; currently , approximately 77@@ 0.000 living units have already lack@@ ed in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people lived in large cities not@@ ated in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
&quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel M@@ om &quot; &quot; because of the lu@@ te on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
&quot; in this way , the tax rate tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended . &quot;
&quot; moreover , attractive tax break@@ downs are needed according to the Alliance . &quot;
the support programme for refugee accommodation in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have already been accessed on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , since more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that passing through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border was cut off , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; moreover , new laws , which entered into force on the same day , practically render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated , &quot; You can travel through and we are preparing for this eventu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning .
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports originated from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet at the border fence . &quot;
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , little more refugees arrive after the closing of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 arrested people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closing of the doors on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws stipul@@ ate the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Sz@@ eg@@ ed border town in Hungary .
the defend@@ ants were sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been placed on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; on the border , of which nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
13 families with small children and two elderly people are among the applicants .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had stayed there . &quot;
&quot; practically no one , however , has a view to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it . &quot;
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people over the past weeks on the road@@ side .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the detention camps in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reached a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge feast on Sunday we were occupied with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the stream of refugees with Austria , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had the un@@ hoped @-@ promised guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we have already said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man could not afford to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire department .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was set off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , tags before a two @-@ bridge run sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially moved the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ i circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

&quot; the may@@ hem at Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first recording centre , Konrad , has already gotten a grip on . &quot;
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday , was without great confusion , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad anticip@@ ates a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in a year @-@ long period . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will have to be found over the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be available to the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the provincial governor , he has already had talks . &quot;
&quot; they would have assured him , also to create districts for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria , it &apos;s going well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the Asyl@@ um Co @-@ ordin@@ ator also puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it is not possible for Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ geber to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the sur@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is successful in placing more successful , says Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am an older gentle@@ man who cannot be told un@@ truth without further notice .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to inc@@ ur any costs , as they themselves declared . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , our own search engine has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected persons are currently unable to take these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be tested for their suitability . &quot;
the director of the city council is critic@@ ising the allocation of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also need to contribute .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday proposed further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continued trip of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , in doing so , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , that Austria once again carries out controls on its borders , it is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Wer@@ ft and later also acquiring some of them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wishes to cooperate with the new neighbors - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises to say : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; at 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; D in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , pl@@ ywood hand@@ bags are the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now grown in the form of another business loc@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and appar@@ el from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before that , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have thought for a long time whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the large @-@ scale Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has put her mother in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
&quot; for me , most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so some woman gets into rap@@ ture when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with last security . &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful bag of every outfit is recycled .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp arrived from a village whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia , concerns journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US pres@@ idency s@@ wir@@ ls the campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dresser is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ site is related to him over - ump@@ teen corners with him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , among which Tru@@ mp also belongs to the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to the word &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the enco@@ ders , they say . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp Succ@@ ess Story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; however , the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a start of film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
&quot; he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States , and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as the Polish , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the American somewhat detached , &quot; he is always so fur@@ ious . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ aire Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine this from Donald &apos;s , &quot; said the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie @-@ singers , also in the USA aw@@ akes interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Charles Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there have not been any major shifts in the Food Today reviews . &quot;
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull achieved the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this draw@@ back seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these early people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 people . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 5 : 30 PM .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
the woman who finally lands at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips locked up to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; their answers could become the killer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when asked who Wood should choose , if not , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle marked great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
&quot; but Hay@@ den selected the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coaches Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a , and it looks like a wise decision . &quot;
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league comm@@ itting on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding off his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also encouraged Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his desperate catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ nes left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Hay@@ den posed for a photo with fans and kept an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ ag@@ ram .

&quot; because of the high number of refugees , the Free voters are calling for the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the fall of the F@@ W in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bay@@ erns &apos;s schools when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get block@@ ages in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag survey of the Free voters conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Elec@@ torate @-@ Meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the exam , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it did during the Yugoslavia @-@ wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ torate @-@ boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free vot@@ er as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we needed national standards of federal states nationwide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the country policy in Groß@@ er stadt is not supposed to fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ term long @-@ term burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; Middle @-@ level plus &quot; &quot; at 47 high schools , in which an extension of the secondary school of three to four years is being tested . &quot;
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums wanting to do so .
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on the jumps
&quot; according to an over @-@ wide routes , the German stock market has closed a fair and nervous trading history with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon did a firm start of the US stock exchanges provide a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized figure gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ flexible Tec@@ D@@ ax climbed by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the Eurozone &apos;s GDP index decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also booked the trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many Bör@@ si@@ ans reck@@ on that the markets will take place until after the interest in the US and also for the big decline on the terminals on this Friday .
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear issue has inter@@ mitt@@ ently pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left even at E@@ on deep traces .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros for provisions . &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax summit .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investments in forward @-@ looking w@@ afer @-@ technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off . &quot;
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the AC@@ EA industry association announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen &apos;s advantages were driving around 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the retirement index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; in the afternoon , the euro &apos;s course declined to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot;
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 People killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening at Rup@@ an@@ el@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital city of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior investig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ rec@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been ruled centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process of the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ meter area .
&quot; planning is a mixture of trade , commerce and living - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot close to the Old Post &apos;s youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
&quot; which investor does not come into question , is not yet clear . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , no contracts had been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Corner of Great Street , already a few months ago and disman@@ tled the building on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
&quot; for the first time , the investor presented plans for the project for the first time . &quot;
several residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure vehicle
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gr@@ assed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the little sea lie close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening at the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
&quot; for months , the roughly ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects has been in discussion . &quot;
strong reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting marked the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch overlooking all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic through the intended magnitude of the system would increase greatly : &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus charges so that it pays &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , exactly what is happening on a hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches double donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Google ) announced a double donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees escap@@ ing the European nations , as they are fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
&quot; instead of making an announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled from Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / lower $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya torn apart from the war . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity treatment has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily obes@@ e . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who did not receive non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes condition ran@@ ged completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , compared to diabetes , diabetes completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ intestinal group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger reg@@ ression in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we wait too long until we bring people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently increasingly paying attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accommodate all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide wanted to end violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ orable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must reflect on how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four fold increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , who swallow heavily alcoholic mi@@ tig@@ ate inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported to the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said some children can intentionally drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
YouTube videos show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of an inexpensive experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant inf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought to treatment in an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered dr@@ unken in an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency room doctor , treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah had her words and was unable to go when she arrived at the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths via alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from her room .
&quot; the police regarded the sworn plan as &quot; &quot; squ@@ ad@@ rons &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures against the authority of the school . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross pole towards the roundabout industrial area and it was too late that two drivers had stopped at the roundabout .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audience with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta that was standing before . &quot;
&quot; on the accident @-@ related vehicles there was a damage of about 10,000 euros , divided the police . &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ Mittel@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland do they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games , and not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the ensu@@ ing departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands out at the top of the table with five points , followed . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly like that - but we need to continue .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
&quot; now , standing together is so important . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK as a whole .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland declined by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 per cent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an on@@ look@@ er gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January , about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a more flaw@@ less lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; have been able to form@@ ulate it better , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I did . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to mention all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who can contact you for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .

&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale police were called on Tuesday for a breach of a house @-@ peace incident in Pel@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
&quot; Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it went about the positive cob@@ alt wine test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges , and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about raised head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer anymore . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy made the bomb high in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man whom I am going to call - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to grasp . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the point of being personally ?
is the R@@ V@@ L cow@@ ard@@ ly restra@@ ined and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people outside think that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have developed with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the Sunday treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day all the day .
but it had it so on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver flight
the police arrested a man on the weekend following a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ ses and emergency assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy turns back against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations of ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ee allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in jumping .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ cker of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; on the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team gave him confidence , because they were worried that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this time again and again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with a turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it is already funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a cra@@ p . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters had a higher result than the play Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ auses and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team was free on this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit for drug addiction &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly thre@@ aten a life @-@ long penalty because of his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café he could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , warned him . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian Pass , reports daily to the police and stops at an outlet from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three truck drivers involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver re@@ marked it too late , trying in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police shared . &quot;
the cab driver &apos;s cab is completely apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 p.m .
&quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures from children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping cock .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then told the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction , - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were conducted by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
after his talks he was asked with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to have received in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of this year , to viol@@ ate the obligations and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases pending . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the border river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they had reached the German side on foot via bridges and traffic tubes .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday , more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station in comparison to the weekend of Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people have arrived in the capital city until 8@@ am , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of the &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; tropical storm in the south @-@ west &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
storms and storms are mainly expected in Baden .
&quot; according to the DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see circle with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen longer . &quot;
the crowd makes it : every two years the high@@ ways at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars , which are currently very well sold . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents a footh@@ old beneath the largest competitor VW Golf in the view , starting at € 17@@ 650 . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be on new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he comes to trade , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the new model will be able to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in addition , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n cover placed above all hands on the front part : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was specially moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the polished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ deser@@ ted
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court issued an Ex @-@ prisoner of the Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Pen@@ ger Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined to narrow spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a solitary cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on his free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the judges rejected the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and returned the case for re@@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest warrant were decisive for the compensation , an appeal was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot;
&quot; only in April , they did not speak to an in@@ mate , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet is also un@@ worthy of human dignity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was placed between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the case of the Car@@ ls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; therefore , prisoners are included again and again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 shall fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Justice this year , about 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated the resolution of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we create it . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives you the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing each year from the rental price binding , and to these particularly favourable dwell@@ ings , refugees are also applying . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings per year would have to arise , and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find a job in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; says Migration Research Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt in Germany , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on a job for asylum seekers of up to five years ago , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of residence to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of qualified labour , the view is mostly enforced by the fact that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
the lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
&quot; until now , there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contact .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is based on the opinion of Thr@@ u@@ hardt the Royal Road for Employment Integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few sought @-@ after parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ epp@@ ner , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators is to rise strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully @-@ educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state does not for@@ bid asylum seekers or tolerated their studies - the only exception has been Berlin , Interior Minister Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position now . &quot;
study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a refund or tolerance do not receive any services according to the asylum application law , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the eligible persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this gap to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this funding gap must also be closed , say Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; in the future , Islam will play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually abandon the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic ch@@ arities association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heart against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who au@@ rated such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole of society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination place and a General Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities Act for a decade .
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ ance showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racial motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans require long and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention undertake Germany must become a reality in the coming years , if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of everyone . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the refugees that are expected to date , writes doctor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as man@@ power and capacity are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand all newcom@@ ers straight to the registration of health cards . &quot;
achievements could be rec@@ alled later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly dou@@ bt@@ ful that so many people agree with the limited service catalog , which the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors are mainly doing the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated , migrants are becoming more aware of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors &quot; sur@@ geri@@ es , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , she demands . &quot;
many refugees were also helped with more general medical start @-@ ups in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; for example , under refugee centres there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have developed a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even physicians . &quot;
&quot; in order to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or under depression .
&quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder is suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fears of death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sho@@ cks and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only four per cent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw all age groups under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on the brick v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ mans and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stor@@ y@@ line stage . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift for enthusiasts is in the blood of the family . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family casts a spell over the audience with wi@@ t and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record . &quot;
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon fill@@ ings , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ in@@ iness . &quot;
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an is not a problem .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , are read by the possibility of every wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the first commandment : to care for the animals .
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more than 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst starting from September 17th to 20th every day at 5 pm and 8@@ pm .
&quot; on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls was quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to follow Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had boo@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones who warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; chief spokes@@ man said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was worried about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 work@@ stations
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will split into two publicly listed companies this year and separate computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service activities .
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will provide a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will focus on providing previously un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says the company &apos;s declaration . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies can deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger points out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his involvement in the European Championship in the next summer is still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study by Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd. has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the injuries .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last throughout the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from injury , you have a prone period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation inside the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to give a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched during the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale of 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show that gave us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , as suicide rates among young men demonstrated on a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication conducted via social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , viable and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which gle@@ ams through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can relate to each case , even though they often hold back to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing told me : ... &quot; &quot; my hear@@ er role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endangered by themselves , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when trying to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much as my objective out@@ sider status may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Gol@@ ani following his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria arrives at the Champions League on Tuesday and assists PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria made less than four minutes after the start of his champion League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on his way , but after that she missed a number of opportunities before she finally raised her head when Cav@@ ani reached a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish master , since they are not only aiming for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced with his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed to death by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing gun was referred to as the man who was able to bring PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , which hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they didn &apos;t give anything in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ itted in the first half in no less than five attempts , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill in bringing his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c which turned Di Maria into a shot that was chann@@ elled by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth end of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and in the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion @-@ league game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion dollars through share sales
&quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sed raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a share sale as part of its huge redemption plan . &quot;
&quot; registered in London , Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issu@@ ance rights issue brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange at the early Wednesday morning trading .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core posted the $ 2.5 billion share sale last week , as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; on Tuesday , 49 people after a long flight reach the city administration in Weimar . &quot;
&quot; the refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;

the White House endor@@ ses Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings visit in Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; this evening , the US President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will be hosting Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have conducted bilateral discussions . &quot;
&quot; the President &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time also President Obama and President Xi add the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on their way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber es@@ pi@@ onage and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

on the wet highway then the evil awakening was coming .
&quot; at a company in the Got@@ ha district , you can fulfil your dream and rent a V8 US sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang Boss 30@@ 2 with 440 hp . &quot;
this was the result of a 29 @-@ year @-@ old Got@@ ha district .
&quot; on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream then came out and over . &quot;
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , hit the s@@ ling on a wet track and drove into the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured . &quot;
&quot; property damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR . &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern stood shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league champion , two times Club World Champion , two times champion champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann accepted the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça did a contract with Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championships . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .

matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the filling of the film and not in the filling of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ting dis@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a mare beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film , Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against acceptance of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 le@@ vers since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are coming at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide influence and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to discrimin@@ ate against discrimin@@ atory practices . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be viewed as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
&quot; the competition show , which finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten up to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing was part of a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 dollars , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final , and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak by on Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes &quot; , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen any game , and so I want to go quite concentrated in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two of us , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ piece hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the bed , &quot; &quot; said extre@@ mis@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked clearly better at the bull@@ pen and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh g@@ th the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second bass eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped a two @-@ run escape from the righ@@ tist Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finale run on the second , Ver@@ hagen finished the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play . &quot;
it was the leading 27 times in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth session , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit was able to benefit from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the Tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he was missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first row , Hus@@ bands released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , scored a One Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not strike very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever handed @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the throw school .
&quot; he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list because of a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP is painted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the list of injuries to start against T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing from the right hip of the hip since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be killed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved in it are then to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the Wiesbaden city on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted from 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days , according to the government president responsible for the first time , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in Hessen . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he designed the European states &quot; &quot; collective vision &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had gone by military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict comes crashing down at our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary , nobody will be returned . &quot;
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mr Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Security and Germany &apos;s representatives . &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , applied for a special summit for the next week . &quot;
Germany began on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the prime ministers of the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection are compla@@ ining this too . &quot;
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a pencil , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this opinion was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania was to be ruled by a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from cre@@ denti@@ als over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; takes place on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice cap of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean flo@@ ats .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so the moon turns easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
&quot; although this movement is small but still too large for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
already longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; Cass@@ ini had already discovered Eis@@ vul@@ can@@ e at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s Moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time . &quot;
but the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing in Munich several weeks ago
the 1860 München has to ab@@ stain from one month to the offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
&quot; an investigation led to an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association with them . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain . &quot;
&quot; according to Munich @-@ based lions , the diagnosis &quot; probably means four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this makes us hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential obligation of a non @-@ con@@ form@@ less professional . &quot;
&quot; however , the Six@@ ties first presented a defensive man as training guest . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove its ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a heavy collision .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious gl@@ itch . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his lean line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
&quot; man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits therefore supports vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so , green man@@ gos can also taste delicious . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the US package service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company has already begun recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looking for .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 aid for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought forward the parcel services of harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first fo@@ eh@@ ement , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn wind , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and the night to Thursday , the F@@ öhn wind blows through the fo@@ eh@@ n @-@ valleys with a storm @-@ strength . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the morning on Thursday morning we crossed a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind ar@@ cs and a decrease of temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest flow . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , the night falls to Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn wind up until Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ ouses with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ eh@@ n can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , humidity begins to st@@ ow away on the mountain@@ side . &quot;
&quot; here , rain sets on , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated , this has already fallen by large rainf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air is blowing from west to east , a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the North with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer on weekends with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was requested from the work community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot;
the square is symbol@@ ised in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city then as a rotten sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have boo@@ sted him in his later battle against Rome . &quot;
Luther then began the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment trade .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has survived the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective themes , it can seem quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles dedicated to topics like cross @-@ country , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther publishing company with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who deals with the respective scriptures on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into &quot; &quot; today , in current contexts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
it is embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equ@@ als a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; the education already took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work on that , so that I might even be able to cope with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to return art again in a quick@@ est way : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertisement , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to fall into the pictures , let them work on them , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture seeks its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his images . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to the fact that the Bible is not fully compreh@@ ended , but the topics that are important for him , including mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , space found , companies t@@ asked , Ear@@ th@@ war@@ den model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration were responsible for the destruction , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railroad . &quot;
&quot; so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the first municipal committee Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck is now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will still happen , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga set a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football team re@@ acts to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in cop@@ ing with the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle no one can say , that &apos;s nothing to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be of interest for each individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and will help .
&quot; the decisive turn@@ out , however , must make politics . &quot;
&quot; the German Football Association therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the si@@ delines of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign on the stamp &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ cot jam instead of the usual sponsor company logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler said the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes on everyone , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their places had started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association will present 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees together with the German Federal Government ( DF@@ B ) and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up all the money for 2015 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP executive vice @-@ president loses an eye on accident
&quot; according to several reports , the Board of Management of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed@@ ging , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out onto the road - he told us this last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you fall .
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twe@@ eted a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as a reserve owner for the two Common Mar@@ ots of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely broken down . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change his pedi@@ gree at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he announced a change at the position of the go@@ al@@ keeper . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Chief Musi@@ cian Roman citizenship . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , he leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also deny the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ceful statement by Mit@@ ter@@ player Re@@ us , that the final let@@ tering for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , believes Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think that we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility era &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA .
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide fewer jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries that come together with representatives of industry at the IAA .
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio . &quot;
&quot; in order to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to make use of the permissible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to advocate a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; however , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are still to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the investig@@ ators Dek@@ ra , only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be able to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents reck@@ on up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent could be seen on the motorway in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic jam . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at ping @-@ p@@ ong @-@ Euro
&quot; according to current status , the Düsseldorf Chamber will only be able to beat the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision shall be made latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , head coach of the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; explained the single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ zeit in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; back then Timo was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; that is why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; declared the fifth @-@ fifth of the world . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow @-@ player from Bas@@ tian S@@ ho@@ ven pointed to a sh@@ ale .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights are window mannequins , which , thanks to video projections , look sc@@ ary human . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the walk@@ way ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; he was actually on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ er . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man , which has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall workmanship , for which much effort was spent : to fr@@ ot@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich with 14 tons of material . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he then taught himself how to disc@@ ard fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
but then I bought some of them .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - lace as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters . &quot;
&quot; embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , who used them for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer possible today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ gran@@ te@@ es . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion has played a major role , was then pushed aside by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that re@@ jects past styles is an increasing order potential . &quot;
who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken off . &quot;
&quot; private specialist shops , as well as the wholesale trade , are almost no longer available . &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass production is much cheaper in Asia , and is almost exclusively sold via chains . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it weak@@ ens export , currently to Russia and the United States . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year , we have produced a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used .
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies , which must first of all think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design often only slightly varies in order to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the machine stops small chi@@ cks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional pl@@ um lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , she shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en tip - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings and would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; is not a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was charged with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new spin @-@ offs and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new opportunities for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a right @-@ state business environment and making the market more open , said the Statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and simpli@@ fying the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli joined the meeting as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to offer consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which receives a corresponding job from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full interest in pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , based on the still existing limit values , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , like car@@ p mostly so low , are so low that they meet the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans that accumulate primarily in predat@@ ory fish above the food chain .
&quot; the German government is therefore cau@@ ti@@ ously warning that &quot; &quot; small amounts of especially un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; can cause &quot; &quot; small amounts of harm to the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health risk for the general population &quot; cannot be expected . &quot;
mercury arrives above all through coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations are meeting more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; was quoted in March out of the paper . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
