&quot; ( a ) In accordance with this Convention , the Community of the Organisation has given information on core material that is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the systems which are for the implementation of the securing measures relating to this material of receipt . &quot;
B ) The organisation requires only the minimum level of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the agreement .
&quot; ( II ) Information on systems shall be limited to the minimum level , which is necessary for the use of securing measures with regard to core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to the agreement . &quot;
&quot; C ) In request of the Community , the organization is prepared to test investment data which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable to check in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; this data does not require the organization to be materi@@ alized materi@@ ally , provided that they will remain open to further examination by the organization in the premises of the community without further notice . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation gets the consent of the Community and States to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) Compl@@ aints the community either against a proposed denom@@ ination or at any time against a given appointment , so the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternate names . &quot;
&quot; if due to the repeated refusal of the community to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , the advice is given to the refusal by the general director of the organization - in the following referred to as &quot; General Director &quot; - with the aim of meeting appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; B ) The community and the affected countries take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation , which are actually able to fulfill their tasks according to their agreement . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organisation are set up in such a manner that i ) are as low as possible for the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities under peaceful nuclear activities ;
( II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organisation for knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks according to this agreement , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to the Convention will be termin@@ ated with regard to core material when the community and the organization realize that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is no longer usable or practically not re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community notices the transfer of core material from the states that are subject to the securing measures according to the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to the Convention will be termin@@ ated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has taken over responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents , from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; the association with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances , can be termin@@ ated with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material during the duration of non @-@ application of the securing measures is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ ers .
&quot; B ) The organisation and community make a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used in such activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this agreement will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is kept on the ongoing basis and the composition of the material contained in the State or the States concerned and on any transfer of such material from this state or to these states .
&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or an under secret protection of the military activity and does not refer to the use of the nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow from this agreement in carrying out their respective obligations . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special search for the organization , will reimbur@@ se the organization of these costs , provided that it has been made in advance in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the cost of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that the community or state against the organization or the organization against the organization or the organization against the community or any state due to damage - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - is settled in accordance with international law .
&quot; the Council , after examining the relevant information submitted by the General Director , is not able to verify that no core material that has to be subject to securing measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices may be reimbur@@ sed in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and may also take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; such steps have taken into account the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied security measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - every justi@@ fiable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , on request of the organization , the community or state . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek that questions , which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , are examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute related to an establishment of the Council after Article 19 or a measure taken by the Council , disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled upon request of a party to submit to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal that consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also ren@@ ders two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed as arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth , which pres@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application , the Community or the Organization shall seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint this arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the Organization , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention advoc@@ ates non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization regi@@ sters that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( II ) if the Community of the Organisation has notified that it is able to apply its securing measures with regard to this State , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contractual parties regarding a change in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) All changes require the approval of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization from any change in this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention remains in force as long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; agreement &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning securing measures .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bi@@ fur@@ cation of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear spr@@ inkl@@ ers for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a jun@@ cture through the risk of early discovery .
&quot; to enrich the target set in article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the re@@ visions by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which the material quantity demanded for a certain period of time , which is not specified for a particular period , is specified under specification of accuracy limits for the specified amounts . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their re@@ visions , the organization is making full use of the Community &apos;s securing system after Article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following kind of use and they , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined and expe@@ dient in the supple@@ mental agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of the core material and stocks ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures to evaluate accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which points out the core material base for each type of material and the changes in this stock , including the one - and out of the material picture zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) precau@@ tions , ensuring that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ b material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) , divi@@ des the organization of the organization the quantity and composition of the material , unless specified for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced to the states in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety precau@@ tions mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of core material that is subject to securing measures according to this Convention is temporarily not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and community to each other on the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be termin@@ ated under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community establish that this core material is practically not re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures according to the agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when it is used in grams or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 that is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community free the organization of core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this agreement , from these securing measures , if the entire core material quantity delivered by this article in the states is at no time more than &quot;
&quot; a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ( III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) , &quot;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons , de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; the free core material should be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to the Convention , processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which is required in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to the agreement , in particular how the procedures established in the agreement are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended with no change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the Organisation , the Community and the States undertake all the efforts to allow these agreements to come into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this deadline requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in article 62 , the organization establishes a summar@@ ized inventory of the whole , the securing measures of the underlying core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory of inventory because of the following reports and the results of their inspec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation , to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general res@@ sources of res@@ sources . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table that is apparent in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to by the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker and uses ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive debt of the member state , which is to pay on demand in the currency of the concerned state in order of the organization as a manager of the special transaction account and to leave the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time , which was agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may request payments before the aforementioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional draw on the cash or the j@@ ou@@ les to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and compens@@ ate for the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in gran@@ ting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit absorption capacity to loan conditions without discounts ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; every transaction loan is to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is considered the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices financed by the organization funded by the organization , which is considered to be the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement as the purpose of the addition to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; therefore they are ref@@ und@@ able in ten free @-@ years each in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch must be made directly to the organization which re@@ tains it .
&quot; each special loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the recei@@ pts from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or made . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are and the according to what the car@@ et@@ aker has set at the time of the loan granted , recipient of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; until complete awar@@ ding of all the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker has informed the EEC concerning the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation and on the projects approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction loan , the cust@@ odi@@ an organis@@ es the EM@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the car@@ et@@ aker transfers a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the cust@@ odi@@ an of the EEC convey@@ s as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account , and the amounts paid to the account , and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States are visible . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account , lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or plans financed by special action groups , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organization may agree not in force , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be obsol@@ ete with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount has been paid back to the member states in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual member states and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Member States &apos; governments mem@@ ori@@ ze the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications with an Not@@ i@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows on the day of the entry of the mentioned notification in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is translated into two original manus@@ cri@@ pts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally binding . &quot;
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE ME@@ ET@@ ING :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Nu@@ clear Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; is represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , its construction and operation of a Common Business under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; since up to the practical use of controlled fusion still carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contract parties of the present agreement to summar@@ ize their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research efforts , which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps by amal@@ gam@@ ating its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and consequently the common objective of these research activities , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive electricity generation through the use of controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom program , &quot; and &quot; Swiss program . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties agree to a new program , this will take place at the site of the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association provided in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of staff under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland takes part in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 number 1 of this agreement , the contractual parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom takes care that Switzerland is involved with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the date of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Business J@@ ET , whose statutes it accepts . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom takes care that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract , whose aim falls within the scope of the present agreement , except for association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , mand@@ ated by the association provided in Article 2 , paragraph 1 of the present agreement , are described in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the association agreement fores@@ ees the establishment of a steering committee , including the competent representatives of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , and to direct the best results achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; V@@ G . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters related to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , takes this task as regards all research and development activities referring to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the affiliated bodies and direc@@ ts its T * competence in the interest of the two contracting parties to the common objective identified in the Eur@@ atom program and in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly considered . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking this . &quot;
&quot; the consulting groups , which submit the V@@ G research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the directors of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors who monitor the conduct of the Eur@@ atom program and responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories involved in the work carried out within the program are optimally util@@ ised , fulfilling this task with regard to all research and development work carried out under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of it between the laboratories participating in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees employed within the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordination committees , which offer the best possible use of the resources , the personnel as well as the knowledge and skills involved in conducting the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work carried out under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research representatives of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of the future programs and the establishment of their overall volume , coordination and integration of national activities on community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the comments of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the V@@ G to the imp@@ enet@@ r@@ able actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties involved work on the works of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies that are created for the purpose of the present agreement .
&quot; the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom program in accordance with this agreement will be held annually on an amount that is at the cost of Eur@@ atom &apos;s program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland , last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland re@@ tains an amount equal to the Common Business J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the provisions of the statutes of this common company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for financing the works within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contributions to finance the works , which are made due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount to cover expenses within the Eur@@ atom programme for the year that is concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council will pay the Commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before 15 .
July . the remaining payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are specified in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom of duties or other donations as well as import restrictions and restrictions will be exemp@@ t from the part of the objects financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland or acquired items in this country may neither be dra@@ ined nor free of charge , unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves . &quot;

&quot; ( 1 ) In terms of this Convention a ) , &quot; wander@@ ing species &quot; means the total population or a ge@@ ographi@@ cally restricted dividing population of any species or any lower tax@@ on of wild animals , of which a significant portion is cy@@ c@@ lically and fores@@ ee@@ able one or more national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; B ) means &quot; &quot; conservation of a wander@@ ing species &quot; &quot; the tot@@ ality of the influ@@ x that mig@@ rates to this wander@@ ing species , which could influence long @-@ term dis@@ sem@@ ination and population size ; &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; conservation situation &quot; &quot; is regarded as &quot; &quot; favourable &quot; &quot; if 1 . information on population dynamics indicates that the wander@@ ing species claims to be a viable part of their ecos@@ ystems in the long term ; &quot;
&quot; 2 . the spread @-@ area of the wander@@ ing species is neither reduced temporarily , nor seen long @-@ term , to be restricted in future ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . present , both at present and in the fores@@ ee@@ able future , sufficient habitat exists to preserve the population of the wander@@ ing species in the long term and &quot;
&quot; 4 . the spread and population size of the wander@@ ing species reaches the historical conditions of extent and extent in a mass , in which potentially suitable ecos@@ ystems are present and this is compatible with a sensible use and use ; &quot;
&quot; d ) applies the &quot; &quot; maintenance situation &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; un@@ favourable &quot; &quot; if any of the conditions specified in the previous paragraph are not available ; &quot;

&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic , the trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat &quot;
&quot; I honor me to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define rules about import@@ ing H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina ple@@ dges to ensure that the actual quantity of the agreed annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed according to conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should any change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties agree to each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under the number 10 in order to find a suitable solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes up the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina regulated by this agreement is not affected by the Community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
&quot; the community ple@@ dges to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products covered by this agreement to a substitute of 10 BC , ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot;
&quot; with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the quantity ordered under number 2 corresponding to the volume of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the lev@@ elling rate of the exhaus@@ tion is taken into account under the number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 is set on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of slaughter . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions , in order to prevent the sales of meat from frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation , not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , are only carried out at prices and conditions which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the general customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities stated in this Agreement have been issued for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina from the presentation of a export licence , which is provided by the competent authority appointed by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the products in question .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trading with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I am instruc@@ ting to take on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define rules about import@@ ing H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a joint market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recogni@@ zing the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the export of lamb and lamb in accordance with the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat is not affected in these markets , I honor the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - Fresh or frozen H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat will ensure access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sale of his mam@@ mot@@ h and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actually executed volume does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the specified quantities are carried out in the conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the Community .
&quot; if a change in the offer form will be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 in order to find a suitable solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes up the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect itself from this agreement with the interests of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community ple@@ dges to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a substitute of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts stated in clause 2 corresponding to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the lev@@ elling rate of the de@@ ple@@ tion will be taken into consideration in clause 5 . &quot;
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 is fixed with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community on 245 500 tons of slaughter body weight .
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb @-@ meat on the Community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of meat in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , are only carried out at prices and conditions which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , so that no export licenses have been issued beyond these amounts . &quot;
&quot; the community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand from the presentation of a export license , which is granted by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the products in question .
&quot; in terms of execution , the competent New Zealand authority of the competent authority of the Community regul@@ ates the amounts in regular intervals , for export licenses have been issued ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;

&quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all the questions that arise in the implementation of the agreement , which shall be submitted to him by a contracting party , and recommends the appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement apply car@@ ef@@ ree to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount specified in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .

&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of Internation@@ aler units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in single preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ cker , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation . &quot;
the Tit@@ er announces the dil@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ opic and visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which the International Standard Prepar@@ ations are present ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ anium of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a cur@@ able form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the feasi@@ bility study ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 v.@@ s. its weight if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the agent ( or the solv@@ ents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic unless the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml of flu@@ ently or re@@ dissolved ser@@ um .
&quot; re@@ agents , in@@ different whether in the cur@@ sed form or after the replacement , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;

&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written about all stages of production and inspec@@ tions of the re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination written records .
&quot; reasonable samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept in the laboratory for such a long time , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their active part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents may contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container , a black on white printed label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

non @-@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood ser@@ um must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ds of A1 and A2 blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same trials are performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of equal activity . &quot;
&quot; if anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) is mixed to an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of same avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity can belong to one of two species , which differ by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached . &quot;
&quot; with others referred to as &quot; incomplete , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods . &quot;
some &quot; incomplete &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells which are absorbed in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may be changed if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons imm@@ uni@@ zed by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a titanium from at least 1 : 32 versus c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison of c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is intended to use object gir@@ ders according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons imm@@ uni@@ zed by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ds of human red blood cells containing the An@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; therefore , these Ser@@ a are only specific for the C @-@ An@@ tigen if the blood cells were tested in a 0.9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object gir@@ ders according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and no form of anti @-@ D may contain ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a titanium from at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ dd@@ d blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which is intended for use on slides according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and in no form anti @-@ D must contain ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination in 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be directly obtained from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions set by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um for use on object gir@@ ders is determined according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be lower than in the ant@@ aneous antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals which can be imm@@ uni@@ zed by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB , including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; there is no human red blood cells containing no A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ator , separated with floo@@ ds from A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B to ti@@ ghten red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if anti @-@ A ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same attempt with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard preparation of same avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals which can be imm@@ uni@@ zed by red blood cells or specific substances of the B @-@ group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; there is no human red blood cells containing no B @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is , in parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ ator , to ti@@ ghten the group B blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; if anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals which are imm@@ uni@@ zed by injection of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; if it is used by the manufacturer &apos;s instructions , there are no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , regardless of which blood group they belong . &quot;

&quot; based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and Member States of the Community and by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to the simpli@@ fication of the border formal and the rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; in the measure that the community has decided to strengthen the internal market within the action programme , to introduce a uniform administrative office from January 1 , 1988 , &quot;
&quot; in the balance that it is appropriate to simplify the mort@@ ality in the goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single administrative agency , &quot;
&quot; in the event that this Convention may not be interpreted in full , that it exclu@@ des the contractual parties from their obligations arising from other international conventions . &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the procurement of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single paper ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after called shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the mort@@ ality associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are obtained by means of a single paper , for which prints are to be used according to the patterns in Anne@@ x I to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the standard paper is used as an application or paper for export , for shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - expressly requested to carry out the legislation in force in a contracting party , whose application is not guaranteed in the sole use of the single paper ; &quot;
&quot; - must be requested by those involved , so that they may come upon application in the enjoyment of the advantage or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the contractual parties , simplified procedures , also using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the involved parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fying procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the concerned goods are not to be put to a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete application may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , a registration in which it can act with the consent of the competent authorities in order to negotiate a peri@@ odic collective registration must be submitted within the deadline set by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted instead of using the standard paper . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion paper is used , so the parties can join with the consent of the competent authorities in order to obtain all the problems associated with the export and import@@ ation of related subjects to the standard paper in the trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;
&quot; - to include agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the mort@@ ality for their entire goods , or for partial sectors ; &quot;

&quot; - permit that registration , if necessary , be created by public or private data processing plants according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - permit the competent authorities to request the necessary data to be entered into their data processing systems for the treatment of applications , and if necessary without giving a written application ; &quot;
&quot; - to allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the applications , that the export , shipment or import registration either by the single paper produced by this system or , if such a paper is not created , comes into effect by entering data into the data processing system ; &quot;
- App@@ lic@@ ences adopted by the Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 .
&quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the provisions required for the export , shipment and import@@ ation of goods required by the single paper are laid down in Anne@@ x II to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The joint codes , which are to be used in the pre@@ prints mentioned in Anne@@ x I , are to be found in Anne@@ x III to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration shall be issued in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the loc@@ alities for the export or shipping are authorised . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country or its representative in this country may request a translation of the registration to the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Differ@@ ent in paragraph 1 , registration must always be made in one of the official languages of the import country if it is carried out in this country using other copies of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative can use for each individual process section of a trade agreement between the contracting parties , which can only be used in this one section necessary to obtain the required copies , which may be added to the examples required for the creation of the specimens in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) Use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; however , the competent authorities can un@@ cover the special provisions on collective shipments , however , that the authorities will be authorized to export and shipping procedures to one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the specimens envis@@ aged for these jewels . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be satisfied as far as possible that the information contained in the copies posted in the individual proced@@ ural sections of the application shall coinci@@ de . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure smooth goods traffic between the contracting parties and to facilitate the discovery of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries issue each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or rejected in whole or in part , if the requested country of the view is that the official aid would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or harm a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In case of den@@ ial or rejection of the official assistance , the corresponding decision and its justification for the seeking state shall be communicated in@@ comprehen@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) Ad@@ ults the customs authority of a country for administrative assistance , which she could not afford , if she is seeking , she points out in her discretion for this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information received pursuant to paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention and enjoy the protection , which has received the national law of the country , which it has received , for information of this type . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the customs authority , which it has given , and subject to the restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) There is a mixture of mix@@ tures , in which each contracting party is represented by this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) There is a Rules of Proced@@ ure , which , among other things , regul@@ ates the con@@ vocation of meetings as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term . &quot;
( 5 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee may employ sub @-@ committees and work@@ groups that support him in his tasks .
( 1 ) The Gem@@ ist Committee has the task of ad@@ minist@@ ering this Convention and to ensure its proper application .
&quot; to do so , the Committee is regularly informed of the practical experiences with the application of the Convention ; it speaks recommendations and summar@@ ises in the case of paragraph 3 decisions . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Committee shall decide to make changes to the annex@@ es to the Convention , as well as the relief of relief mentioned in Article 4 ( 3 ) of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Mi@@ xed Committee has adopted a decision under the reservation of the requ@@ is@@ ite of the constitutional requirements , the decision will take effect on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; every contracting party will take appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this Convention , with the need to take into account the problems loading the goods traffic as far as possible and to carry out satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily satisfactory solutions when applying the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , as well as for the areas of EF@@ TA countries on the other . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This Convention also applies to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein , as long as the Princip@@ ality is associated with the Swiss Con@@ federation by a customs union agreement . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement under observ@@ ance of a 12 month period ; the written termination is to be addressed to the de@@ posit@@ ary mentioned in Article 17 , which noti@@ fies them to all other contractual parties . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , if the contractual parties have depos@@ ited their acceptance documents with the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities by November 1st , 1987 . &quot;
&quot; if this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988 , it will take effect on the first day of the second month after depos@@ iting the last certificate of acceptance . &quot;

I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for a cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , called by its Commission , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; may ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Council , &quot; to ask recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will meet this desire as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . in view of the Commission &apos;s responsibility in managing fish stocks , the Council cons@@ ents to submit all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the inventory and reports of its advisory board of fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly advise on how to intensi@@ fy the cooperation between the two parties , and in particular investigate the opportunities presented by the Commission to establish a closer connection to the Council &apos;s Advisory Board of F@@ ish@@ eries . &quot;
4 . the community will pay a total of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ k@@ r in the signature of this agreement and then make annual payments .
the annual fee does not include the costs for meetings which are conven@@ ed on special request from the Commission .
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties shall be re @-@ examined . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement will be extended on the basis of existing provisions until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
every party has any time to withdraw from the agreement under observ@@ ance of a one @-@ year notice period .
&quot; with regard to clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognise a scientifically qualified representative of the Commission to recognise the observer status during meetings of the Advisory Committee on F@@ ish@@ eries Management . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask for the word and to participate in meetings , but would not have the right to vote , nor the possibility of changing the agen@@ das of meetings . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would tell me if these agreements as the basis of a cooperation between your council and the community are acceptable for you .
I assume that this letter and your answer will be the agreement on cooperation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community .
