this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) in which it is explained how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that are dissolved in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. enter@@ tain thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal pitch ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy is used for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for preventing man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the enam@@ el tablets in patients showing difficulty swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are just as ab@@ ili@@ fy as ab@@ ili@@ fy , the dose of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence . &quot;
the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases caused by increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , to prevent re@@ occurring , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with ab@@ ili@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that had suffered from increased un@@ rest with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received ab@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms in the application for treatment of bi@@ polar disorder than plac@@ ebo .
ab@@ ili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of stolen rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of ab@@ ili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled access ) , ac@@ ath@@ ome ( continuous movement ) , anxiety and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I mal@@ functions , and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were compared to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared with the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for placing A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients showing mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ab@@ ili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for ab@@ ili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in cases of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher risk of suicide associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients suffering from known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions associated with hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sen@@ sing drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia with an ab@@ bili@@ fy , you should consider reducing the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ n , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including ab@@ ili@@ fy , must be depos@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients suffering from sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including ab@@ ili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with ab@@ ili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , which permit direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar aff@@ ection due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ il@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the common gift of eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with ab@@ ili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be raised to the can at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with ab@@ ili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on metabol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns arising in the animal reproductive studies , this medicine may not be applied during pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ome , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled trial of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters arose , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared with 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their incidence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ at@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ality , undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate re@@ do@@ si@@ ations with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed solely in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosage is beneficial as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma rotation . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor , as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D3 @-@ receptor @-@ lig@@ and , at the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a week 52 Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the respon@@ der patients who contributed to the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion rates scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patient population ) , an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in week 3 and an explanation effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the average elimination of Eli@@ mination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ ites via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia . &quot;
there was no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study involving patients with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect in the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects comprised a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accum@@ ulating and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al cell carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ X of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of hydro@@ xy@@ - aria pra@@ z@@ ole are not more than 6 % of concentrations noted in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 fold of the medium Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for single doses of aluminium in folding cart@@ ons with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; 34 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of the meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing ab@@ bili@@ fy tablets may take the enam@@ el tablets as an alternative to ab@@ ili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in cases of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for ab@@ ili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;

it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patient population ) , an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
&quot; 99 In addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ X of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 fold of the medium Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of pre@@ valence and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended using obes@@ e regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , ab@@ ili@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or ab@@ ili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ o@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with pre@@ valence and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is deemed necessary , patients should be observed with regard to an extreme sed@@ ation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients suffering from known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions associated with hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sen@@ sing drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar aff@@ ection due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly used and the simultaneously received lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ous , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in the case of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be raised to the can at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following adverse reactions were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters arose , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared with 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their incidence reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ at@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ality , undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution compared with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of Agi@@ ator / behavi@@ oral disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as Agi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in symptoms regarding the likel@@ ihood and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement from the initial value to the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analysis of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe p@@ opping , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the total population , but a statistical significance could be detected on account of a decreased patient number . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study week 52 the share of the respon@@ der patients , who contributed a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study goals , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ Rate Scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % of plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the esc@@ ort therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed itself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after injection of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time up to the maximum plasma pi@@ ping was used for 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was toler@@ ated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration with a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which lay 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
&quot; in studies of the reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application no safety @-@ related concerns were based on mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects comprised a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accum@@ ulating and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ alin @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ alin @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold the average steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with that of a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; looking at only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in efficacy end@@ ants such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it should not be used for patients who are breast@@ feeding or having low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , and that in contrast to other medicines containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel it has not to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Company &quot; &quot; Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science &quot; &quot; a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 the treatment should be interrupted , until a recovery is reached by grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function were carried out and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data for the harm@@ fulness and efficacy . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ em@@ ulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel which could significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ s count rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is returned to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly identified cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardi@@ al incidents in the indicated patient collective are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patient after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a occur , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practise effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to one month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised in advance of the treatment of a sperm count , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ anes is the possibility of ir@@ reversible bar@@ r@@ enness . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can impact on the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects , which were performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects performed in conjunction with the Gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , f@@ lange pains , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
&quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite , related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients &quot;
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the mer@@ ging of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ genes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ lution .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ ose of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and demonstrated in @-@ vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dop@@ hel@@ i@@ etal transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs .
&quot; the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two cre@@ amy , un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in form of inf@@ usion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ al study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel in 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of the patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only a ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 . the results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy , are below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml in line with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration took off in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or course binding of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the clearance of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and for two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light over 8 hours .
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle . &quot;
&quot; after complete addition of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good setting of the solid material . &quot;
&quot; then the pier@@ cing bottle should be turned slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted , until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itation or sin@@ king substances are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must once again be gently inver@@ ted to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before applying . &quot;
&quot; the exact overall dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding amount of re@@ formed Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC inf@@ usion bag . &quot;

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels where blood trans@@ fusion could occur if a self @-@ blood donation is not possible before the procedure , and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be monitored before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is present , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not respond sufficiently to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used for surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the effects of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a main study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , with reference medicinal products . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o before they were either moved to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed , inj@@ ected under the skin , were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from a an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were uph@@ eld in the same measure as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components ) .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed it has been demonstrated that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which establishes Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information for the medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to permit the transfer of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( for example , cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia during the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large amount of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot be part of an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and illness is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dosage management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the persistent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to make sure ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and - follow @-@ up phenomena can vary depending on age , gender , and total illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and illness is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dosage management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to make sure ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is used in the lowest allowed dose which is required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the rejection rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased from the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value rose by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , a response to ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood preser@@ ves is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
&quot; the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks prior to the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to allow large iron reserves to be available prior to the start of the secre@@ ted treatment . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin on a ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) , should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients , which are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery and which may not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , vascular disease of the car@@ vot@@ al or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently occ@@ uring cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an antibody medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , considering the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te &quot; Index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin @-@ antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical studies an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ins if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required to control the an@@ emia symptoms and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to current knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ related , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for tumour patients under chemotherapy , an 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the therapy efficiency of ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adapted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - can be adjusted with the goal of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patients who should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients , which are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients , who undergo a major orthop@@ edic surgery , should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl is an increased risk of post @-@ operative oste@@ o@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival for tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro investigations on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cervi@@ cal thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically obtained ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that has been isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other her@@ mos@@ a ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 M@@ amm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 64 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed a very consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality compared to the controls with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transmitted to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the goal of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ser@@ um mirror is much lower than the level of ser@@ um that can be obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first dose or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis in relation to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , was not increased . &quot;
&quot; 14 in animal studies with approxim@@ ate 20@@ times of the recommended daily dose , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa introduced to decreased fine body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro diagnos@@ es with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of a maximum of 3 days outside of the fridge and not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so if necessary , the measurement of sub@@ sets is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .

the holder of permission for the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system introduced in version 3.0 and is operational in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. before the drug is put into circulation and as long as it is applied to the traffic .
&quot; the holder of permission for the placing on the market comm@@ its itself to the studies and additional measures for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as corresponding to each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Pro@@ files for human use at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ) .
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • with receipt of new information that influence the current security specifications ( safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures . &quot;
• suffered a heart attack or stroke during a month before your treatment - if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) - if you have already performed such a blood @-@ graf@@ ting disease in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) .
&quot; you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the carot@@ id arter@@ ies ( vascular disease of the car@@ bu@@ ds ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it may result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ es within the normal range , which res@@ ides in further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 , or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the start of therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin sli@@ t ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie , it will break your therapy with ab@@ re@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given through injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with heart or blood vessels and death risk could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically clear cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or shr@@ ink@@ age by insufficient cardiac output , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a particular value . &quot;
&quot; according to the current knowledge , the treatment of blood @-@ hum@@ ility with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood level ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the advantages derived from the treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed will act like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if an orthop@@ edic surgery is im@@ min@@ ent , before treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your blood levels of red blood ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of bleeding after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking / applying other medicines or used it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood@@ bath ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be regular blood tests if necessary , in order to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value . &quot;
&quot; depending on the an@@ emia associated with the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , you can learn if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , also learn how to inf@@ use Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral bleeding , stroke , passing through bleeding disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular dil@@ ations ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men ) , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis of the ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution in applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it may come - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood graf@@ ting ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed may be associated with increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your starting point level is too high

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used or disc@@ ar@@ ded within 3 days . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both for women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic her@@ nia , such as bone frac@@ tures ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ era can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , A@@ cl@@ ergy may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ergy is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of ver@@ teb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medications ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients with A@@ cl@@ era ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medications ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ era occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta should not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ergy provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ergy for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , containing evidence of how the medicine is applied as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the transport of A@@ cl@@ era in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra @-@ indication in pregnancy and in breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When a medical or nursing aid is with@@ drawn &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ergy is recommended once a year . &quot;
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed only by doctors , who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with A@@ cl@@ era a long re@@ mission period has been observed in patients who have responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ergy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ergy , can be reduced shortly after the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents at A@@ cl@@ asta are not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data are missing for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as a limited clinical experience exists for this patient population . &quot;
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to treat A@@ cl@@ era with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of therapy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ergy ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be tested before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , there is no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ergy , can be reduced shortly after the use of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation reported in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ergy increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall incidence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
ren@@ al dys@@ functions z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function distur@@ ban@@ ces resulting in the decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis about three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ergy versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were treated in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ergy in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures according to a recent frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dosage of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion center , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area occ@@ ured , especially for cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ op@@ itis and most of the reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 trial of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ opor@@ osis in the max@@ illary field in one patient with A@@ cl@@ asta and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , it can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing fluid correction . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ones A@@ cl@@ asta sen@@ ked significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ergy @-@ treated patients aged 75 and over had a 60 % reduced risk of fluid correction compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , of the th@@ igh@@ s around 5,@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic am were taken one year after the third annual dose . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone structure .
bone trans@@ mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) - the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an early dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cl@@ ergy treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment increased BM@@ D to total assets and shr@@ ubs at all times .
&quot; over 24 months in comparison with the plac@@ ebo treatment , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment resulted in an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total assets and 4.3 % on the threshold . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to reduce clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of treatment in the Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ era was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moderate heavy disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) . &quot;
11 . the efficacy of inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in combination with the combined results , a similar decrease in pain volume and pain control was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at were able to maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ern@@ ron@@ ate , aged 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma tile swi@@ f@@ tly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi @-@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long eli@@ min@@ ating phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages ( α and β with the above ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; total body clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease in the concentration of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced clearance of met@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems met@@ aboli@@ zed substances is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function to down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
&quot; because of severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute Tox@@ ic@@ ity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous single dose for mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C was 6 times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was determined in rats by doses of 0,@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures exceeding the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all doses , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and those of skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of decreased ser@@ um calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra @-@ indication in pregnancy and nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When a medical or nursing aid is with@@ drawn &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; risk management plan The holder of permission for the market is obliged to conduct the studies and the additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 004 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the application for authorisation and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP approved by CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management System for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is announced , which could influence the current statements for safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk prevention ) was achieved . • At the request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , the bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is built un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ era . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ era with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines of which it is known that they damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ergy together with food and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ergy . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ asse two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ era works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get you can work A@@ cl@@ ergy more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before finishing the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta If you are considering the completion of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; adverse events related to the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ergy . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have such symptoms in yourself after you have received A@@ cl@@ ergy . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or cri@@ b@@ bing or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

continuous pain and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects may be significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to make the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ era two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ergy , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; because of the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ era . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ergy . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ergy . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more
&quot; in addition , four studies have been conducted to over 7@@ 0,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting up smoking compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete list of adverse side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is the package bite . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from existing severe depression or to be treated with anti @-@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can be caused by a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to the lack of data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied , unless the benefit of the treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; he also in patients who - besides the obesity in themselves - have no recognis@@ able risks , can cause depres@@ sive reactions . &quot;

• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; patients suffering from over@@ weight patients as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition to 38@@ 00 patients in further indications . &quot;
&quot; the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of adverse effects in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients , which were treated for weight reduction and because of accompanying metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ates ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of persons were given dispos@@ able income of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² or an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ emia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6,5 kg relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;

&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases the onset of con@@ vul@@ sions with process @-@ related stress appears to be associated with the handling of animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the p@@ airing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on the fertility or cycl@@ ones . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats to pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by means of lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or in memory .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can be adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sulph@@ onic acid or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which causes type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered at the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the addition of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 289 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ critical ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , or in patients suffering from liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos will be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the launch of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been carried out .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should not be used .
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are as soon as possible to control again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , wa@@ xing , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the pre @-@ clinical assessment of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a consequence of hem@@ odi@@ lution , minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparison controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 4.2 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral dup@@ licate or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on a wor@@ sen@@ ing or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , if patients talk about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological explanation should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women , which were treated with comparative medi@@ oc@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment should be cancelled ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and thus reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the turbul@@ ence and re@@ inde@@ xing of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents frequently appeared as often as plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since its launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) were treated with patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ amine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for more than two years in order to study the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years of treatment , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optim@@ ation with insulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , below Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared with the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized to either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , with the top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma generally 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to efficacy is equivalent to the three times the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the com@@ partments ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys according to repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and thus reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) were induced in the bladder epithel@@ ium . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to increased incidence of col@@ ont@@ al tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women , which were treated with comparative medi@@ oc@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of Met@@ form@@ in were studied with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , below Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared with the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both about an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the goal of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medi@@ oc@@ ation , an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women was shown . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in September 2005 , the pharmaceutical company will provide an additional 6 month peri@@ odic safety update report ( P@@ SUR ) and then submit an annual PS@@ UR@@ s to a different CH@@ MP decision . &quot;
an updated risk management plan must be presented in line with the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use .
&quot; if you are ill of type 2 diabetes , Ac@@ tos support 15 mg tablets to control your blood sugar level by bringing better the body &apos;s own insulin . &quot;
&quot; if you are aware that you suffer from a sugar intoler@@ ance , please contact your doctor before taking Ac@@ tos in 15@@ mg tablets . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take more medicines or have taken it until recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ tos 15 mg tablets in combination with other medicines to treat diabetes ( such as insulin , chlor@@ prop@@ yl , gli@@ ben@@ cl@@ amide , gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de , tol@@ but@@ amide ) , your doctor will tell you whether you need to reduce the dose of your medicines . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ eg@@ els , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar level was similar to another human insulin . &quot;
acet@@ aph@@ one should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may have an effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is to take from the package bite ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh@@ ed with the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , may change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi @-@ phase , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA over insulin origin ) may cause a change in the dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , taking over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the doctor must consider possible interactions in the treatment and always consult his patients after other medicines taken . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods . &quot;
&quot; diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape pieces , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or given by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the effect maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

acet@@ ap@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin has to be raised , followed by the amount of insulin acting long . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , taking over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and complaints at the destination Occ@@ asi@@ onally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the effect maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data is limited , however , suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usion systems with acet@@ ap@@ id in concentrations 0.05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin human in inf@@ usion fluid 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - Glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable when using inf@@ usion bags made of poly@@ propylene at room temperature 24 hours long . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or arthritis no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; , &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ zation , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there are still deaths . therefore , it is recommended that patients take more medicines at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ o@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drug ) and of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared one year to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood lay under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who received 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) received 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements , a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver parameters . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases , which have already resulted in causes of urine ( including a poison node and / or arthritis ) known from the medical history . &quot;
&quot; if the Ser@@ um endurance bar is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration for AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ ts Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , the application of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensation heart failure treatment is not recommended with Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ettle drugs , it can come to acute arthritis during the course of the treatment , because the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ stick seed saw can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han Syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of February , and in the subsequent course , depending on clinical findings and a liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not carry out an exchange rate studies on Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a inhi@@ bit of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous addition of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen had been associated with an increase in Feb@@ rau@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without having a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
&quot; in a study of subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) delays and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C causes . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be close to side effects of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or when performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall file group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a degenerative heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients receiving col@@ chic@@ ine at the same time . * * In clinical trials , severe skin r@@ ashes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years were treated with Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during the long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all February 2008 treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to data from time to time . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ com@@ ings , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin irrit@@ ation , erectile dysfunction , increase in the blood concentration in blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te numbers , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the effect of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolic process in humans and is produced within the framework of the reac@@ tion@@ sk@@ as@@ k@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at is an effective , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients , in which the last three monthly periods of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment at study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus 80 mg . &quot;
reduction of the level of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ness to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in the doctor visit during week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the progression of ser@@ um urine acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ urine acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing was found in &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required a treatment against a poison flow ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a poison control ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the number of no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma ec@@ centri@@ city @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased dose @-@ propor@@ tion@@ ately after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ment concentrations has been observed , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma cutting of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at amounts to around 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary attachment to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ r draft glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the urine was found in the urine as un@@ modified February ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cos@@ a of the active substance ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ modified February ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cos@@ a of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x from Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ y utri@@ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ y ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function function .

&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In case of male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( intermediate cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ controlled group , with approximately 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ ating met@@ aboli@@ zation and urine composition and are not considered relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , which lay approximately at the 4 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity came up , accompanied by a reduction in inf@@ ancy and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which are about 4.3 @-@ times and in case of carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated with 90@@ 6 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients , in which the last three monthly periods of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing was found in &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required a treatment against a poison flow ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a poison control ) . &quot;

&quot; the holder of permission to transport the medicine has to make sure a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is described as in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , before the drug is put into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is put into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented at risk management systems for human medicine with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities of risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk prevention ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of dis@@ comfort is achieved . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC should not be taken , • if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the active ingredient of Feb@@ ra@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC ) . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor before taking this medicine before taking this medicine , if you have a heart failure or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are suffering from a high ur@@ inary acid concentration in a row of cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a poison effect at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the toxic@@ ity is gone before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be so , but could also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a toxic@@ ity or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking / applying other medicines or used it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; it is especially important for you to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use medicine , which may include one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC can occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urin ( for treating as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood dil@@ ation in heart disease ) &quot;
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on the traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC after consultation with your doctor if it is known that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the individual week@@ days are printed on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken an over@@ dose , contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , take it as soon as possible unless the next dose is before . &quot;
&quot; if you break AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , your urine acid concentration can increase again , and your complaints can wor@@ sen because new urine crystals can form in your joints and kid@@ neys as well as their surroundings . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where a risk of a low vitamin D mirror exists .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should be taken at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than with those who received only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data to show that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , which is needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as su@@ pr@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 710 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should be taken at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , only be given with special care ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; reactions like es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hospit@@ alization ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out at the onset of symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , it was rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ aw@@ bone , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ op@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy was predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , indicating whether to use bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduce the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw . &quot;
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet next morning while taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before beginning treatment .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , but most reports have been reported by cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis patients have also been reported . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ calcium deposits up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ stit@@ uting an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ sis to vitamin D3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ lic D3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;

after 15 @-@ week treatment the mean level of ser@@ um levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic acid were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) than in the group at Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) lowered significantly after 15 weeks the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lic D &lt; 3@@ 7,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs . ) .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years of 8.3 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.6 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D by spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was also maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg per day over 2 years and then 10 mg daily ) was taken either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before consuming a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability rose to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have revealed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; secre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ partments . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) , after consuming AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours prior to intake of a meal , the mean area below the ser@@ um concentration period ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) was for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without taking account of endo@@ genous vitamin D3 ) . &quot;
the mean maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 amounts to 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time to the maximum level of ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; in the liver , Biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver and then met@@ aboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ lic D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form , met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In combination of radio@@ active mark@@ ed vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the rot after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients Pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is rapidly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at Non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential do not allow any particular haz@@ ards to humans . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , and the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients where the transplan@@ t was exp@@ elled after a year of treatment ( for example , for example , how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more recent studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were performed and examined , as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of the blood ( hyper@@ kal@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and in@@ som@@ nia . &quot;
&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule over@@ board with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange cap@@ s@@ ular part with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ time immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician &apos;s transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) .
&quot; after the change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral treatment cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initial dosage for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection should begin once a day .
&quot; in adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients Ob@@ aly had no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , resulted in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood @-@ tal@@ ons in the desired area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including regular measurement of the ser@@ um cholesterol level , calculation of the cre@@ atine content and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the levels of blood in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; the blood @-@ level mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low clearing , adjustments may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
the indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of the seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case of kidney and heart @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and heart gra@@ ft recei@@ vers , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which can occur in a consequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician &apos;s transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rejection , which have proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; to pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic the transplan@@ t rejection of adult heart gra@@ ft recei@@ vers and transplan@@ t recei@@ vers in childhood , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to lowering the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to substantial fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , an anter@@ ior chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ rup@@ tions are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid pollution and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions by appropriate clothing or use of a solar control using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose are present in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ painting . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can monitor , monitor and monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole , and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly do@@ si@@ fied pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rep@@ ul@@ atory reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly careful . &quot;
the results of animal testing have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the immune system profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) . &quot;

&quot; cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours associated with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular range of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent of the T @-@ Hel@@ pers cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ats et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it came to 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were converted to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

&quot; in one study , the incidence of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ al study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients receiving a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , which received a random@@ ized trial tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral Initi@@ al@@ dose ( per Protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target levels of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on showed an actual survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ age and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients , which were converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

advoc@@ ates are used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII ) con@@ genital blood cl@@ utter disorder .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human t@@ anning factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another drug known in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is manufactured differently so that the drug contains no proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the drug was used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ats in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of advoc@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the human scent factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the transfer of advoc@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the given plasma chamber ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed . &quot;
repeated injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with adequate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the speed should be directed following the patient &apos;s control , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ related with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gues ) inhibit@@ ors is observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which were all performed in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected fall of the VIII century blood cl@@ ots came post @-@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or was determined after exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ surge and a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were occasionally reported on the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hel@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ins in several repeated product compositions as part of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the approval date , CH@@ MP continued to evaluate the benefits of risk weighing as positive , but considering that safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ ATE &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a sub@@ missions of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , so that the application holder should apply for another extension process in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited appointed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company will withdraw its application for the handling of Adv@@ oc@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
it is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ant@@ ine would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of under@@ growth , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company , some questions were still un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the submitted documents , CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ oc@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful not to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not notify CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ oc@@ in . &quot;
&quot; modified active release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young people aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ut@@ ched . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all h@@ ay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunt ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used for patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used for patients suffering from con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival hyper@@ tension ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ roid gland ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ roid gland ) , or even a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stro@@ kes ) . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cr@@ acking , breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for the harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after blades of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as in long term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data is insufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosing .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function distur@@ b@@ ance , and the data is insufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosing . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that the treatment should be depos@@ ited in case of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nau@@ sea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; caution : • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in An@@ am@@ n@@ esis , Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test no significant differences were observed between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither is a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies have however no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it may lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular col@@ lagen ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal attempts . &quot;
&quot; anxiety , anxiety , fri@@ ghtened intake , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ st@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary aci@@ dic and - dil@@ ation , skin filtration , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on the standard measured sizes of the flow , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
controlled clinical studies showed no increased incidence of sleep@@ iness in comparison with plac@@ ebo at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal aller@@ genic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 414 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall result for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the slow@@ ing effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are poor@@ ly confused . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was to exhibit after applying a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive ox@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral presentation of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the regulatory application , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal aller@@ genic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tears or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; if you take aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
transport and operation of machines For application in recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , m@@ outh@@ wash , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat ache , loss of appetite , appetite , appetite , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness . &quot;

&quot; following the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has rarely been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscular pains , depression , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of eye @-@ catching cir@@ rho@@ sis has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablets , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg of mel@@ ted tablets ( tablets that are dissolved in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( among them four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies on patients who had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by det@@ ecting the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance during the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores was treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe appro@@ ving A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy of the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of any allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current illness process and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed during re@@ occurring symptoms .
in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol is not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it may occur that may result in impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported daily , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches , which was treated by 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses given in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on the standard measured sizes of the flow , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ arly recti@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; since hi@@ stam@@ ine deficiency is a caus@@ al factor in all arian diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may lead to an improvement in symptoms except in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population were comparable , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither is a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ less film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ ess , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hypo@@ cris@@ p , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious r@@ hin@@ itis associated with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years of age met@@ aboli@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and learn a higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol is not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adolescents aged up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily average dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the progression of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents was not determined by increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ omot@@ or activity . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced power impair@@ ment or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and young patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets will effectively reduce the caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis caused by r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rants at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the distribution of this limited , met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater among Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , with the sy@@ rup formulation to children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults , who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets once daily put in the mouth to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy of the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must carefully be opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet will be taken without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the results of the disaster and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Schmel@@ z@@ enges proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the inclusion of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;

&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flow of fluids , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among Black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was , however , not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied at pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dosage studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melt tablet showed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation during clinical use .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;

the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; small children between 6 and 23 months were the most common side effects reported more frequently than in plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years were observed in a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents was not determined by increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively be allergic to the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets will effectively decrease the burden caused by seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company received its application for authorisation for the use of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is to protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from man to man , because human beings have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; corpor@@ al &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was dis@@ connected with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body det@@ ects as a corpor@@ al ) , cleaned and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs of the patient before , and the probability has judged that the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of am@@ gener@@ ase depends on the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicine am@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the study with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a virus load less than 400 copies / m@@ L than plac@@ ebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children A@@ gener@@ a decreased also the viral load , however , with the children , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few were treated to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ a strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger det@@ achment of the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components ) .
&quot; am@@ on@@ ase may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals that are degra@@ ded in the same way as aspir@@ in and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking a@@ gener@@ a are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) or an immune re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were out@@ weigh@@ ed over four years in comparison with the risks .
&quot; am@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of am@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was given at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the shipping of A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
normally A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boost ) , higher doses of am@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for the harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of am@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy may not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ generated ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
normally A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with advanced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of am@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are mixed with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the side @-@ level function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous appointment of am@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
patients who take this medicine at the same time can be less effective for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s reduced plasma gas ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , however the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ generator solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ation should be set to 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot;
many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy medicines which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ sis .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ opor@@ osis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width am@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width am@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with drugs whose active ingredients are predominantly mixed with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the degra@@ ded plasma chamber by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently undes@@ irable effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already enters the St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ als and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when it is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; up to 508 % , C@@ MA@@ x decreases by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , proving the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % decreases if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous dosing of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended due to the anta@@ sia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in that the proceeds of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and am@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may possibly reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ asp@@ is . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous addition of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rif@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , it is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could be the plasma chamber of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ urine ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors , or In@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when used in combination with aspir@@ in .
&quot; based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as aspir@@ in as it can result in res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plas@@ m@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous taking with as@@ cor@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days at subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma chamber increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous application of am@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is heavily dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma gas are expected at the con@@ current administration of as@@ cor@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to my@@ opathy , including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
therefore ac@@ gener@@ a must not be used together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while taking care of a@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am should be applied .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma gas from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at present , as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in case of simultaneous activation of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with am@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be applied only after careful weighing of the possible use for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the nit@@ riding in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the seed . &quot;
the further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether it is related to taking aspir@@ in or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of am@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were classified by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ther@@ ly sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ t fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ aking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patient under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ules nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontan@@ eously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ eously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients , which received 600 mg of am@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and frequency of side effects ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed in patients who received a@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to be observed at signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ ye@@ - poly@@ protein stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ oid treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates were gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not performed pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M . &quot;
&quot; conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
analyses based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) , and ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ulates ) . &quot;
&quot; in reverse , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to am@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ ak@@ age threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached ag@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of age from which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies A@@ generator solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot;
there was no low dose of de@@ pressed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared with the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be taken into account in case of therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; aspir@@ in .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
508 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x to be reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or pose a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney failure to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may be minor . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those that are obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were diagnosed with dos@@ ages containing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of this findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test were contained in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T , and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of am@@ on@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boost ) , higher doses of am@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or slight liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ation should be dis@@ continued in duration 27 , if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; up to 508 % , C@@ MA@@ x decreases by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous dosing of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , it is recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days at subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma chamber increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of simultaneous activation of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with am@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may be applied only after careful weighing of the possible use for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the nit@@ riding in the uter@@ us until the end of lac@@ tation , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the seed . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is to be observed at signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; in reverse , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , treatment optimisation should be taken into account in case of therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or pose a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction can be reduced to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were diagnosed with dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to man after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the assumption of clinical relevance of this findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ ating the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake was not covered in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to take out ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups is avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ a solution for inf@@ ants and children under 4 years is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ generated ase does not prevent the risk of getting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ation should be dis@@ continued in the long run , if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with medication 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ sis .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; up to 508 % , C@@ MA@@ x decreases by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous taking with as@@ cor@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma ec@@ centri@@ city was expected to be significantly higher after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the nit@@ riding in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight in the seed . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether it is related to taking aspir@@ in or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ oo@@ ster@@ oid treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
&quot; early termination of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment . &quot;
62 Based on this data should be taken into account in case of therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; aspir@@ in .
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large volume of c@@ ous@@ ins , as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • With small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is up to a maximum of 16 weeks to apply three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is to apply five times weekly during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is applied thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin so that it leaves enough long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ tro@@ ph@@ ous ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; to apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible spru@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ y area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
&quot; an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) , or when an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot;
&quot; if a follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and to be cleaned in the cleaned , with side @-@ war@@ ts infected skin area until the cream is fully enclosed . &quot;
it should be weigh@@ ed in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be weigh@@ ed in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ an was performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with a circum@@ cis@@ ions leading stri@@ pe were observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed even under proper application , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous app@@ liqu@@ és on the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital and per@@ ic@@ an@@ al@@ area , there are currently no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of bow@@ el reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after finishing the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other suitable therapeutic forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ ci@@ dal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips . &quot;
there are only very limited data about the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses at anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ische Ker@@ at@@ osis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the efficacy of this purpose , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually take over the course of therapy in intensity or go back after setting the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient cause great dis@@ comfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither in one @-@ time nor after several top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be applied during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the most frequently shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream associated with side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated bas@@ al patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the side effect , were in these studies a reaction at the application place ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
&quot; side effects , which were given by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; this according to the clinical signs suggest@@ ing that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often result in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ec@@ c@@ ori@@ zation / dro@@ pping ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ den ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the clinical signs presented according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe ery@@ them@@ ics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe de@@ formation and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was identified with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental , unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that effectiveness in relation to full healing of the genital war@@ ts is significantly superior in case of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
&quot; at 60 % of the overall 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the genital war@@ ts healed completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared with 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external fo@@ xes , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super @-@ fever bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively . &quot;
a minimal systemic occurrence of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest dosage concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml when applied in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ value after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
&quot; the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 , and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ del@@ ectable bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were related to significantly lowered body weight and increased mil@@ ky weight ; a study on der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors in the application .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ated , a risk for man is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the acting @-@ free cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was examined mainly , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by investigating the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under 5 years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion position . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) . &quot;
&quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be disclosed , and where necessary to update this summary . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to monitor patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms regarding the reaction to inf@@ usion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B@@ V , a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union . &quot;
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary and ov@@ arian of the Chinese hamster ) .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or hep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting in which re@@ charging facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience exists regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction must be cau@@ tious after a break of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before starting inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to treat the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed again with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 become ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occurs .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , is recommended during treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms not too silent . &quot;
&quot; side effects in clinical trials were mostly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug interactions associated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , there were also serious reactions including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe running form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the onset of treatment , whereby the patients aged under 5 reached a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version during the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say , including 3 patients , in which it had never been converted to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with out @-@ to @-@ low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ eg@@ els in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ghtening , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason@@ ing for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease range , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited when they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for a further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the plac@@ ebo group improved lung function and ability to be presented in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not statisti@@ cally significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
within the first four weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined which remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ations between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant change inter@@ sec@@ ts for five effici@@ encies ( normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , motion range of the shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the medium course form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased Gag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in a number of patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z score for this age group The younger patients with the severe post@@ age form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium course form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation only limited or no progress in cognitive development were detected . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute level test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available , and if required , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in mal@@ ign@@ ant administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified with any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients receiving other chemotherapy regim@@ ens prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , reduced or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA , thereby preventing the cells from sharing . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of p@@ emet@@ ric mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural les@@ ion , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived aver@@ aging 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each pier@@ cing bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage forms is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with l @-@ k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as inf@@ usion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the conclusion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also have to receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dosage and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ re@@ eds , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before every addition , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria conform to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if in patients after 2 doses of dose , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
clinical trials have no indication that patients aged 65 years old or older compared to patients aged 65 years have an increased risk of side effects .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical studies patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to exceed the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the occurrence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone @-@ reg@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients prior to their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ p@@ hili@@ a again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality count , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as they were observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ec@@ ologic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been clin@@ ically examined if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients must be applied , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - l@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients where these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally if this ingredient is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treat@@ ment@@ - G@@ inn to get advice on how to preserve sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed seg@@ reg@@ ation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is advisable if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used for high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , to be avoided at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or r@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , must be avoided at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , unless mandatory and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the spar@@ mak@@ eover process . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ ric mixed into the breast milk goes over and unwanted effects of in@@ stit@@ ched inf@@ ants cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ ial cells , and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ ry mixed as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ ial cells , which were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which performs its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed works as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several Attack points by blocking thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ in@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ amid ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in and purple nucle@@ ot@@ ides . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural corneal end@@ othel@@ ial was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control area .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ al , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy followed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with ALI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival occurred in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial type ( n = 172 , 9.1 versus 8.0 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ric mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T Population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combined with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed according to gift as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usi@@ ons over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is re@@ discovered within 24 hours of the application , unchanged in the urine . &quot;

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the test . &quot;
&quot; it is used in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , some fats can not be degra@@ ded in the food , thereby leaving about a quarter of the fats associated with food in@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the All@@ i 60 mg used to record an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , down@@ turn o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( waste ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
All@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ ory or fat @-@ reduced diet .
All@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 as there are insufficient data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the agent or any other component • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fet@@ al single meal or a high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etic medication should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or elevated blood cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to take additional pregn@@ ancies @-@ prevention measures , in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma chamber was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick Val@@ ues ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after receiving a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a marginal number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at were observed , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic , fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
&quot; † It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to conversion , with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and over@@ weight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar adverse events were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid atro@@ phy of several systemic effects can be trac@@ ed back to the li@@ pas@@ ti@@ zing properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect places in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ ene @-@ rest of the ga@@ stro and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the dietary fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fet@@ us diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those students who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
for waist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable in 8 hours after the oral presentation of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 . in general , non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and can be detected without signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which were given the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine @-@ group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ produ@@ tion ox@@ ic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; the most common side effects are linked to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects generally occur within the first weeks of the onset of treatment , as you may have not yet consistently reduced fat content in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize diet @-@ related symptoms : • Beg@@ inning already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat quantity evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a high @-@ fat main body or a substantial night@@ stand as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet . &quot;
• Do not store medicines for children in@@ accessible . • Do not use any more than 25 ° C according to the exp@@ iry date . • The bottle holds two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
follow the below tables below . • Recommen@@ ded fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount is suitable for you , take a look at the information below that indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not go climbing stairs , work in the garden or other physical activities daily . • &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calories and fat goals and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a food diary containing information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a dietary plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fat food and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of al@@ oh@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug which can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient is the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies involving 1 842 adults , which received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong , resp@@ ectable trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ ha showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , versus 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ ha showed no results in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer illness and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of al@@ oh@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients should be monitored closely with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is provided with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agent , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for preventing nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ ale met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous addition of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ o@@ dar@@ on , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , can@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ iti@@ dine , can@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the experience of the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ ha , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the meeting ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were given in post marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ value 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received , which was given day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and di@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine , 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given on day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption Acc@@ ording to intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tion@@ ate in the whole can range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ gs@@ m / kg for patients and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the overall texture ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved with once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ able of 0.75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elimination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the total body of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function impair@@ ments , the terminal elimination of the elimination and the average systemic exposure increase with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre@@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose induced in approximately the 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary gland , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique applications , the relevance of these results is low for the human being . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infections ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue det@@ ects damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are increased . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon has submitted data to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; in addition , concerns are expressed as to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug that is marketed may not be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was re @-@ treated with more patients than with the reference medicine ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test used in the study was to investigate the question of the extent the drug acts an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( fis@@ sur@@ es or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go does not act against this type of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should review the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. to appro@@ ve Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients who do not show any improvement within two or three days should be examined once again , and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully removed and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treating infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary @-@ infected open wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved by humans after top@@ ical application on s@@ wollen skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After an oral application of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , on s@@ wollen skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not required if top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity following oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy is to weigh for the woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which used Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most commonly reported side effect Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the meeting place which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial DNA that differs from the binding points of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
&quot; by binding this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infection forms , an expert advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption in a healthy adult study received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily with oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and sk@@ inn@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medi@@ oc@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 was s@@ lic@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with less involvement of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mice lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ lic@@ ed skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; the holder of approval for the market is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Pro@@ files for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms shown at the treated spot , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment is se@@ wn on one of these surfaces , wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gaz@@ ette tape , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cl@@ asp that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0,5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two cans , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation and that the vaccine existing from two cans can be brought to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a r@@ ash dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix and other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by att@@ aching the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix vaccine since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vaccine existing out of three cans . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the use of ambient air . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix caused a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentration against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from ambient was similar to a six and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , red@@ ness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the active agents , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ori@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ virus anti @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since it may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation schema with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody is achieved , so that additional vacc@@ inations may be necessary in these cases . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ oral injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could result in a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can , however , be inj@@ ected as exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activ@@ ated tet@@ rac@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ om@@ ers and preser@@ vatives @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher rates of pain and skill based on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis per vacc@@ ination ( Ambi@@ rix ) , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the test persons after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable high ( i.e. throughout the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were compared to 36.@@ 2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to the observed combination vacc@@ ination using the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
&quot; in a comparative study with 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambient , a common incidence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per sample , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B treatment regim@@ ens , was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials that were performed at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for Anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 . &quot;
&quot; the immune response that was achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines were either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that , after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial at 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to those in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refres@@ her vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ sively on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in water contaminated by sewage . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus before administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If your child already has an allergic reaction to ambient or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has ever performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambient .
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vaccine series .
&quot; sometimes ambition is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / your body &apos;s immune system , or if you / your child is under@@ going a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking additional medicines ( including those who can get you without prescription ) , or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given or has been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with ambient , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ rix will not be given to pregnant or nursing women unless it is necessary for vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed cans ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at loc@@ ating or red@@ dening • Mat@@ ching • Head@@ aches • Appeti@@ te lack
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed cans ) : • swelling at the injection position • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ aded • g@@ astro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; other side effects , which were reported very rarely after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 doses ) , are : &quot;
&quot; these include restricted or extended precip@@ itation , which can be it@@ ching or ves@@ icle @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye section and the face , cat@@ astrop@@ hic breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects affect you / your child considerably or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of up to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of data known since the first approval for the market launch , CH@@ MP rejected the view that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; form@@ al@@ dehy@@ de - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do medication , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste of taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ia in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the disease , only limited information on this medicine was given at the time of approval . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use , if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ge@@ scar@@ path@@ y .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the emergence of Es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each pill AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate via the liver and kid@@ neys takes place , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in humans is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients were at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which has developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ress dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage was a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms occur with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in the intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ ase excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
it is important that the diagnosis is early and treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of the pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many for mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ drink scar@@ path@@ y deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enz@@ ym@@ atically con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured following dose of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lic compounds or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was detected in the following morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is taken either or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal area . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ge@@ scar@@ path@@ y .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat rap@@ ins were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before birth , it came to les@@ ions in the pyram@@ ids cells of the cereb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which has developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ress dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ ase excess
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram the generated sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in gran@@ ules , 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon , 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can not ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine may go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , dis@@ infection of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you determine one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the introduction of appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood balance ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , reduced appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin smell , skin r@@ ash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and anom@@ al@@ ous laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly imp@@ aired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; you may no longer use AM@@ MONA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the box and the container according to &quot; &quot; us@@ eable to &quot; &quot; exp@@ iry date . &quot;
&quot; as AM@@ MONA@@ PS looks and content of the package AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If your lab tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS , because So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS in the same single doses or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ le ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; use a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The amount remaining in the measuring sco@@ op corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Rem@@ ove the recommended amount of spo@@ ons gran@@ ulate from the tank . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used for treating adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for instance in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; st@@ ressing &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effects of an@@ gi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another antibody ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or one year in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to bi@@ val@@ ira , other mil@@ k@@ ud@@ ine , or any of the other components ) . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to permit the launch of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) for emergency intervention or if early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended starting dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an IV @-@ mg / kg intraven@@ ous dose followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a further consequence of a PCI is performed , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion for the duration of the operation will be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a release of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is given correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ira against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose can be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ val@@ ira Po@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us was accepted without a dose @-@ adjustment in average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the agent or any other component or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible retinal disorders . • Sever@@ al un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • Sever@@ al ren@@ al damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; during the treatment , patients must be carefully monitored with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ira is administered in combination with another antibody ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if most of the cases of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture occur in the case of PCI patients suffering from arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during treatment in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ira , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ira is again reached prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; the experimental studies are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ira , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ira , plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ fac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira Group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years more frequently than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ Dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding site , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; spot points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ tiers in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira is immediately termin@@ ated and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ira , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ ia , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as in the anim@@ ore region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ lo@@ ins are bound in the liquid phase or at bar@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira Vi@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it was possible to indu@@ ce no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) with ser@@ um of patients with ser@@ um @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ira shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI has been carried out below , an additional bol@@ us should be given from 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ira and increased inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in the arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed across the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ C changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went a angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on four@@ fold and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients under@@ going a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in Table 10 . &quot;
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ira were evaluated in patients receiving a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ira as Pep@@ tide has a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re @-@ evaluation of amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; the primary metabol@@ ite , which results from the split of the AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence by thro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
the elimination occurs in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a process of first order with a terminal half @-@ time of 25 ± 12 minutes .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regul@@ ating glucose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or unable to process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter operation time than a short @-@ acting insulin insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where insulin is not effective in which insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison with a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin lis@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % for human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components ) , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage needed .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin , and can therefore be changed during conversion of the treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
&quot; the substances that can increase blood glucose levels and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yram@@ idal , fibr@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , phen@@ yl@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , with the effect of sympath@@ etic drugs such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c opposite regulation can be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive ox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the adverse drug restrictions known from clinical studies are listed , group@@ ed according to system organ@@ - and classified according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , ligh@@ the@@ aded , excessive dog , head@@ aches , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is neglected to continuously change the injection position within the injection unit , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active time shorter than with the normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ ystem effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal insulin insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ystem effect about 2 hours earlier than insulin insulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ pran@@ ational gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; the insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was acquired , a better post @-@ den@@ ial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Fig . 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at dose 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
