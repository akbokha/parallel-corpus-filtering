<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR) in which it is explained how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that are dissolved in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. entertain thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal pitch) alternating with periods of normal tuning."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for preventing manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavioural disturbances if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the enamel tablets in patients showing difficulty swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are just as abilify as abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprzol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing mental or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo, to prevent reoccurring, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection Solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that had suffered from increased unrest with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the patient's symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly increased the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms in the application for treatment of bipolar disorder than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of stolen restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled access), acathome (continuous movement), anxiety and exhaustion, restlessness, restlessness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of bilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I malfunctions, and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were compared to the treatment with Aripiprazole compared with the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for placing Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients showing mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased efficacy in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorder, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in cases of treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher risk of suicide associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients suffering from known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions associated with hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensing drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports on Dyskinesia occurring during treatment with aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if you encounter signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia with an abbilify, you should consider reducing the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of Mns, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be deposited."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients suffering from seizures in anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesired cerebrovascular events with aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents, which permit direct comparisons."</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar affection due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as a side effect, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Familine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by Aripiprazol by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common gift of etoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the can at the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns arising in the animal reproductive studies, this medicine may not be applied during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters arose, showed no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared with 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, and their incidence in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, spatdyskinesia and varicality, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate redosiations with Aripiprazole were observed solely in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosage with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosage is beneficial as Aripiprazole has a high plasma rotation."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine dopamine and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor, as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, for the alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"when applying Aripiprazole in dosages from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11c-Racloprid, an D2 / D3-receptor-ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and at the putsch."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a week 52 Haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of the responder patients who contributed to the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depression rates scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return that was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin-controlled, multi-blind study at schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective 'weight gain' was, under Aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient population), an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in week 3 and an explanation effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazole showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partly did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the escort therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilizing phase before randomization, Aripiprazole showed itself superior to the prevention of a bipolar reverse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydration and Hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">"the average elimination of Elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolites via CYP2D6, and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites via CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazole, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia."</seg>
<seg id="91">There was no reference to clinically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripigezol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study involving patients with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect in the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproduction oxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects comprised a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulating and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal cell carcinomas and combined adrenal-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes).</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can be adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulphonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulphonic acid or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which causes type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was investigated; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>

<seg id="756">"Actos led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered at the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the addition of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl resin in a reduction in HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin, showed a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypocritical (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>

<seg id="1656">"for adults and young people aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clutched."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received desloratadine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunt), mouth-dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used for patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine, or any of the other components, against adrenergic active agents or loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may not be used for patients suffering from conjunctival hypertension (increased intraocular pressure), heart or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroid gland), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroid gland), or even a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by cerebral hemorrhagic strokes)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the launch of Aerinaze in the entire European Union."</seg>

<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for the harmlessness and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after blades of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as in long term use the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, lisurid, cabergoline, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin etc.)."</seg>

<seg id="1912">"this low dose Ritonavir enhanced medicine amgenerase was compared with 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors, with other protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"in the study with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, more patients had a virus load less than 400 copies / mL than placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir."</seg>

<seg id="1977">The simultaneous addition of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, it is recommended to reduce the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available."</seg>

<seg id="1992">Therefore acgenera must not be used together with orally taken Midazolam (see section 4.3) while taking care of agenera with parenteral midazolam should be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma gas from Midazolam to 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"if methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if even low doses of Ritonavir are given."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at present, as the amprenavir- dose is adjusted when amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"in case of simultaneous activation of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with amgenerase, increased control of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionate in the whole can range of 0.3- 90 μ gsm / kg for patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">"after intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"from pharmacokinetic simulations, the overall texture (AUC0- ∞) achieved with once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable with the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the disposable of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites compared to palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating glucose levels (sugars) in the blood or unable to process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter operation time than a short-acting insulin insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where insulin is not effective in which insulin is not effective, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined in comparison with a reduction of 0.14% for insulin lisper."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% for human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic to insulin-ulisin or any of the other components), or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines, which can affect blood glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH to approve Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the decreased gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function."</seg>

<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage needed.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"the time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin, and can therefore be changed during conversion of the treatment regimen."</seg>

<seg id="2991">"after glucoagulation, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lulisin the efficiency occurs faster and the active time shorter than with the normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin in the therapeutic dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosystem effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
