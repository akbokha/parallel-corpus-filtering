&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose Settings Add @-@ ons ... Open the card tools and select the desired modules there . &quot;
this is a list with standard settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules may be on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes if available . &quot;
the module view@@ finder ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras view filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root no@@ des of the document , example : document@@ ations , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in showing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be easily recognised if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View may be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ k display is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either display depth for easy recognition of ne@@ sting depth or representation of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is available at all , only if sufficient space is present or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( and therefore display errors due to restrictions on the character of the Tre@@ k ) . &quot;
&quot; with performance algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ mit@@ ter in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always kept . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as sharing the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to frame always advantageous the areas so square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive divisions . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry view in the area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind application . &quot;
you can find the picture gallery in the &quot; &quot; kon@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; menu under Extras gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the gallery &apos;s appearance . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
the option Pictures per line has a slider bar and a rot@@ ational field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image indicate whether the file names are shown under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; with the image size of the image , indicate whether the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box size , indicate whether the size of the images is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set with a slider or a rotation field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; if you want to copy the original images to the gallery , please specify whether the original images are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the Check box Com@@ mentary file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be set here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu in the navigation pane or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in media playback . &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
&quot; the standard browser identification of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Con@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you are accessing a website that is denied access to this browser , you change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for sites that reject browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser identification to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly represented with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
&quot; with this option , the inserted browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras web page . you can check the following ex@@ ams :

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ous ; work together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plugin Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works fully in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , like &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens that can be searched for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s dependent on the support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and possibilities of improvement .
&quot; this opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link@@ age . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the fault report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the fault report system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ses ; then we would like to encourage you to join the user mail@@ ing@@ list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; and hopefully soon to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ ous ; to participate is logging in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ el ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and database . you can specify a local , remote or removable file here . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many files as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came ; you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . setting up digi@@ K@@ am collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ ously ; considers any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . during browsing the folder you will get a progress report like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ es recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folders . this can be done without insert a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change the albums by using any photo from the album and print it on the folder icon . you can find more details about this in the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ ous ; make your digital camera setup . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ous ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission .
&quot; photo 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras which support an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and comm@@ its over the serial port this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . the Exif support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation might be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plugin Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ ously ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop pictures everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the al@@ der tree , via the horizontal separation line or in another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the tool@@ bar at the moment . so , the filtering on the file name will only work if this ind it &apos;s symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the al@@ der settings . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ads ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ous ; these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ign or after the date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album features in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos , if you want to sort or delete collections from the tool@@ bar or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used if you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sort by .
&quot; the button el@@ dest , average , new ester : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or that of the cut of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ ous , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ ads ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; Select as album preview ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be emb@@ ell@@ ished .
&quot; the collection includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . each picture is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lu@@ pin buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this in which you can re@@ use all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will appear below the associated preview . what information these are , you can be digi@@ ti@@ zed over settings ; set up . select the albums page here and adjust the thumb@@ nails to your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such a help window .
&quot; photos are everything about &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can view all the functions that have been digi@@ ti@@ zed with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select image editing , you can view your photos and edit them . &quot;
&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening with . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image , so this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the Pre@@ view and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ came ; delete it , it is moved to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or Del case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My dat@@ e@@ sli@@ ders &apos; ; organiz@@ es your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ ous ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or groups . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this key@@ word or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will appear . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby you can organize your tags log@@ ically . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ list , so that you can easily find the tags you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or on an existing key@@ word and then select New keywords . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this is the key@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the location of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in a tree .
&quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking and selecting key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree , &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the picture in the context menu . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you have chosen the photos you want with a key@@ word , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &apos; ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the thumb@@ nails thumb@@ nails and assign the key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of tags . the photo will appear as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it was made . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ eli@@ bly adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . &quot;
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ end S@@ earch@@ box is a small lamp that becomes green when searching matches . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can find this search here as a live search , which always filters what you &apos;ve entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just need to select the appropriate entry from my search list and select an option in your context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit searches , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select an advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you find more rules for the search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . all rules will be added , separated by operators . each option can be added to the search group / search group . each option can be added with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , None ... or Min@@ At ... . in addition , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; the lower the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ist , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from anywhere via the symbol of un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ ous ; finds the right pictures . here too a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ dictionary . you can push in or zoom out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em illuminated from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and open its window .
&quot; from the thumb@@ nail you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is visible . if you preview du@@ b@@ bing from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate through pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions work directly from the light table like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy , for example , to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to hit the visible area of the picture , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in mode Pre@@ view , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zoom function as well as in other views . just use the zoom regulator under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are pre@@ viewing in the Pre@@ view mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process follows after the picture has been made up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scann@@ ed or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;

&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management accepts , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , manufactures and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is in accordance with your definition data to provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use it certainly not &amp; digi@@ came ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger disk at some point . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to enable . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? to do so , add &amp; digi@@ ous ; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , as you should now assign any photo words , cap@@ tions and an assessment . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work . &quot;
&quot; let us now go with keywords , key@@ word , as you often call or category in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded liter@@ al words , then &amp; digi@@ ous ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . the re @-@ sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub@@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to see your photos only , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Om@@ aha Beach quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is it to transmit the meaning to the viewer , help Him through the motif that you have moved has to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
&quot; when you export your images in web galleries , you can even export them for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell chec@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with light speed . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys by pictures with geographical data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a text game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer , or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photograph is a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change them in the image . this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professional professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate errors , plate loss , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread dis@@ belief &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these should be handled cau@@ tious and you can no longer trust you as a couple of years . of course you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece that &apos;s a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and keep them in the right way . the best DVD Rec@@ ording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray Disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media using a description , date &amp; author and then transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that these media can read . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : flo@@ ppy Case Study &quot;
&quot; in short : dis@@ ks will hold the longest when you run at temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temperature acids , the fault rate increases dramatically . some of the errors set out by S@@ MAR@@ T her@@ ald the im@@ min@@ ent failure . &quot;
&quot; this is the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes are different . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es may cause severe damage . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against power peaks is a surge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy j@@ okes and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also includes an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , please ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system may also be protected . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery @-@ energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and run down the system . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as a surge protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in power distur@@ ban@@ ces with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go to the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transmission errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs secure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you see one day a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate interference within the data streams . these errors remain un@@ noticed in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a lower level and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ g file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms to use z@@ fs and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; this is not under@@ estimated ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . with not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ iev@@ es is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spotted . &quot;
&quot; open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most widespread fil@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of 10 megapixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , a sensor size of 6 Meg@@ apixel and a high quality look are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss . secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous , like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or something like that . &quot;
&quot; there is another benefit of the physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two points of time : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or other optical media .
&quot; in the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original maintain , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that precious pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in your childhood or adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of a row if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store g@@ amma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open source format developed by Adobe Systems . DNG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it from the original of your recording , mostly in raw format , archive . X@@ MP matches that because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include the work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the cam@@ er@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ous ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; out ; in the Ad@@ dition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . you can find another description in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be shown . some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer note , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window from &amp; digi@@ ously ; or image editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from All . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ously ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected download is gra@@ yed as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded yet . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All download or download selected , a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos are saved . you can read the list of existing albums as usual folders . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; download the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , you must select them first and then delete Sel@@ ected Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore photos you deleted from the camera . therefore , you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in a &amp; digi@@ pack ; you should carefully check if you want to completely delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re @-@ vali@@ dated after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you want to upload photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ missions . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard auto @-@ identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want another date format than the default format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % M % H : % M : % S . switch on the date &amp; time option . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name option , you can change the file names in lower case by downloading the file names . or Up@@ per@@ cases if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and choose the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ ous ; this is used to automatically download sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are available in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in that case , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date based on the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then , select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the image selection , &amp; digi@@ came ; you see where the images are to be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ guy ; if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pack ; users who want to document the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers together . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographical allocation .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data then you can use this script , which works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ text ha@@ ired co @-@ ordin@@ ates that are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can choose between these , by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; fix when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera folder . &quot;
&quot; this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations like e.g. hired photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the car , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to provide the photo . this does not have to be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be listed here as this is the picture other &amp; quot ; offer@@ quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ses ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without lost .
&quot; cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the inscri@@ ptions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to define what file types &amp; digi@@ came ; to show , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button actuators to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aire from &amp; digi@@ ous ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you then open the light table , these settings will not be available . the option &amp; quot ; In the full screen size , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are set here . in image editing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; compressed with the TIFF file option , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it has no impact on image quality , because the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works loss @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; with the setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ prone setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in ordinary JPEG . as this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard sampling is that all green pixels are equal . if the rendered green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the highlights . this option is ignored for other cameras .
&quot; the default is the pointed light , so the parts of your images that are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the more pointed colors , as they show the highlights in various ro@@ ses . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the highlights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as quick as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ital Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color soften@@ ing , since it is done during the rough conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a colour space to translate into the other is thus the colors as accurate as possible .
questions if an image is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; see the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; to leave for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , which do not have any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to do the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this response is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the finish : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be downloaded by &amp; digi@@ ous ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper controller adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switched off or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera selected from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you can mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s camera . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for moving images in the bin &apos;s bin , you can set the conversation about &amp; digi@@ ous ; del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without re@@ plying . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the splash screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when starting , this acceler@@ ates the boot process from &amp; digi@@ came ; . &quot;
&quot; the setting to search for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the startup time from &amp; digi@@ came ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ came ; you see if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a quick image processing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and to review and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or from the context menu of preview and selecting the entry / edit item .
&quot; the image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the image editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using file save or button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring from the menu File Rest@@ ore or using the button Re @-@ creating the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit back and restoring , selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the back@@ end or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made any changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
full screen mode shows the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets . whole image pre@@ text can be printed out of your selection . you just have to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export printer assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side bar is available without the navigation arrow , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same tab allows the side bar to appear and disappear again .
&quot; the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the inscription is copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC address field in other applications you should observe these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the labels are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cuts C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the enco@@ ding follows the schema in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the key@@ word applied beforehand . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the given search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication in the input of key@@ words in a picture series . if you have entered several keywords , they are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the key@@ word filter key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - data , key@@ word and searches are used . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all the keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the above example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter refers to no words , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and after that a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn up and stored there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off at Settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an Advanced Search for all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adjusted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanner can have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograp@@ hed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes to color management , everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow fulfil@@ s all the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
&quot; your only other picture output is by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use a different color space to think about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB means that your monitor closes with s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alizing , Ab@@ same , Automatic Differ@@ ent and Con@@ tr@@ ast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try automatically out of your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ ans the lumin@@ ous intensity over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or well @-@ washed .
&quot; sometimes the balance equ@@ ates very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either produces miracles in one image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re @-@ ji@@ us@@ ti@@ zing of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is a little limited because of a colour gam@@ ut with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in rough mode , which works in the 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ody . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image . &quot;
the target photos preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your results depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade alignment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and load it later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button pres@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely distributed JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding requires more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ ton@@ ing can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted from the chapter of color management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use them for multiple photos at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool colour effects gives you four colour effects , a solar thermal effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ opy filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment ultimately creates a negative picture that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contra@@ sting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on lights .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . you can experiment with the result using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than raising them . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on sound value correction for improving the exposure . even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to learn how to use it is to post@@ p@@ one the controls , and take care of how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis is displayed . for pictures of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controllers : the top for the dark sounds , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color brushes can be used to preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values as inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as background while something else is in the foreg@@ round . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example for adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
Modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere Channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; beside this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most sensu@@ al . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that will dar@@ ker the corresponding picture pixels . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is shown on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you &apos;ve created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if they are found in more than one channel , the combined result is displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the h@@ ues of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window will show you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ancy , the image will retain the general brightness even when you change the color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from the color @-@ bre@@ wing . colour @-@ bre@@ wing is made of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that may not occur at the same place in the color channel and their sound pattern looks different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome version in which you want to reduce the color use first . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any Mixer settings can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ancy option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , at all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filtered . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate moon@@ light rails at the time of the day . similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotary filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ ia : produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit cold in the shades . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ ia . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ ia .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait out of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture defect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
add a frame to add a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired type of frame for your image . continuously surround the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce perfor@@ ated it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ates it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative insert a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image at any place . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you selected for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ guy ; tool template can apply a template over a picture .
the menu image template used in image editing can be used to lay templates over an image .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . you must however take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of a template .
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder in the dialog with the Fol@@ der folder . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the st@@ encils , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder will appear . selecting a folder will automatically refres@@ h the templates . &quot;
below you can see three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the image and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process has to be combined with minimal differences to a color point . this in turn causes sharp edges a bit of bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequent sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often applied to internal sharp@@ ening . on the other hand , images in raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ening already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening tool . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation sharp@@ ening sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharp@@ ening a picture will re@@ focus . you can reach it via the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool to create a soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate plas@@ tic@@ ing and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur@@ ry mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats can create near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a channel of the filter to be applied . thus , areas with a soft switch between the tones are exemp@@ t from sharp@@ ening and therefore avoid fl@@ aws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected release filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing color in image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the auss &apos;s folding . the auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most of the pictures , the default value 1 should result in good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gau@@ ze &apos; sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your Un@@ ity Gau@@ ß is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mask produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , sharp masks always have to create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ry . the result of the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur@@ ry mask . the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original non @-@ sharp colour picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the field of sharp@@ ening in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the knob smooth@@ es the bl@@ ur@@ ry of the area of dark@@ ening to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; colour tin@@ ts provide a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings for fine tuning , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed accounting p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homo@@ geneous regions smooth and details are sharp . a value of 0.9 should be given details so that no sharp@@ ening should be subordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular@@ ity or CCD @-@ Rau@@ schen a high value can produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ . p defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value matching the level of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 ranges from here .
&quot; angle adjustment range da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as the greatest possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral steps &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integral steps in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never exceed 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low , but it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to leave it out . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time to take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how image errors with Kleine art@@ ef@@ acts are removed . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ening level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or smoking tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak diamond or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend you either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ era tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more pre@@ fabricated , to increase . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the phase absorption . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other if it is too high can occur . &quot;
&quot; store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use the tool to create a soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate plas@@ tic@@ ing and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ular@@ ity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digi@@ ti@@ sed images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting . the texture setting is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading . &quot;
below you can reduce how a photo with uni@@ form@@ ly noise is reduced . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ ding on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that have been scann@@ ed by the scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the Hot@@ pixel of photos taken with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark photo extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load it again in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the broken pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixel is measured . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not light the entire sensor range . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ per effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ es@@ and the color or grey stage depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation to a rough image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection uses the transformation with a center filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the level of light strengthening at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of compens@@ ating a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the coating of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation . image editing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the gra@@ vi@@ als in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar tour effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ der correc@@ ts the distant corners opposed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of fourth grade . this value affects the edges rather than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value changes the image size and thereby causes a correction of the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; light : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
the T@@ onn@@ e- or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best result in correc@@ ting this correction as all of the first . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to view the dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Rem@@ ove cro@@ pping out of image editing or via the zoom control of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as shots from the front , frame and painting , is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for pre@@ viewing . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ular@@ ity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the grain texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controls changes the quantity of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gran@@ ny sight , especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film composition effect on a black / white picture applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better for large pictures . smoothing the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the accuracy . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon sket@@ ch . the lines which define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved even further by adapting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey and dar@@ ing landscape .
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Un@@ ity Effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom Un@@ ity : wi@@ pes the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a centre point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ry a zo@@ om@@ ic camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sport photography .
radi@@ al rou@@ gh@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels at one point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
distance ur@@ ry : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ ry : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograp@@ hing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soften@@ ing : bl@@ ur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or adding a warm and subtle anne@@ aling . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives natural your images a wet look . it uses one by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that is free to stay . if you then start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo infl@@ ator is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
&quot; the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation for an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was blown up by I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintained aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and load are used exactly to it . any single st@@ amping for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo infl@@ ator is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Be@@ ading . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear default enlargement .
&quot; the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . to cut a photo , you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then while moving the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are happy with the cut , use the cli@@ pping button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file save or file save in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the thumb@@ nail area , you can change the rect@@ angle size by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio , uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you &apos;re using centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically cent@@ red the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the implementation assistance settings allow you to hide Help so that you can better put your pictures together . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division dividing to different natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flo@@ wering leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number of 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid relief lines if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ bow , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition results in the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden h@@ edge . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles der@@ ive from the golden spiral discussed above . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angle . note that , unlike harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not uniform tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can place a static object dynam@@ ically . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and ver@@ tically mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the Color button , you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool for turning a picture around any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing and tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right top .
&quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after turning a picture you will find undes@@ ired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function trans@@ former cro@@ pping out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic trimm@@ ing . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
left corner at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
right corner at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
left corner at the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cro@@ pping out of image processing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal she@@ ar for example will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module through transformation Sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; drag your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumb@@ nail area . &quot;
&quot; your help will be a vertical and horizontal line . move your mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture is a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single shot this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots testify twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cro@@ pping out of image processing . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous ; &quot;
&quot; due to this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to file a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ came ; you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced , in order to save image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program that came in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ All supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ came ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; understands these formats and will not have any built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .
&quot; synchron@@ ize the metadata between the database and all the files of the current main window . the images inher@@ it the database &apos;s metadata , and not otherwise , as in this menu . &quot;

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images into a K@@ ML file . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; your description follows here .
&quot; use a unified dialogue that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ licate . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area displays the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the picture from which you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar properties displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ dictionary . you can push in or zoom out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder by files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box B@@ oth Curs@@ or is activated under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . you can set this mode by selecting the check@@ box over@@ write under Bei@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Insert . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged using the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find them in the color pic@@ ker on the left side .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; include , are based on the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graphs in &amp; c@@ ates ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; c@@ graph ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graph ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from around 1000 no@@ des and one h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
&quot; further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which requires the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs required . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more info , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zoom is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been changed from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; an instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance , or to display the rotating graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it later with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can change your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page will be adjusted to this page . thereby , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph , distributed on several pages , without head@@ line and with a different font &quot;
&quot; the Up@@ load shop gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or en@@ qu@@ ire the program every time . &quot;
opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; when a graph is opened out of a running session . you can set a default behavior for that case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time it is requested .
the seating management page gives you the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at every start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional options : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are : &quot;
&quot; it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm lays down the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible , and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ ic@@ ited graphs . it produces displays based on the spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p algorithm generates a spr@@ ing@@ back model layout for un@@ ic@@ ited graphs . it uses the Fru@@ th@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi trigger trigger for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the Cir@@ co ; algorithm subordin@@ ates the no@@ des in a circular shape according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify specific options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ ic@@ ited graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; shows the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if available ) . &quot;
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source repository &apos;s base folder .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images to read and store new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner directly supported by the S@@ ane project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; if you open the menu entry images , a dialog box that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by adding the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pushed the button down , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to specify the options of the target image appears . here you can select the compression and type of the image file . here you can select the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image file . &quot;
&quot; you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the &quot; &quot; Import / Screen &quot; &quot; menu in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots : &quot;
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible workplace . &quot;
&quot; the delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot was made , the dialog box appears with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo over@@ lay on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world that show photos of your camera online and show your photos to your friends and family around the world .
the Export module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be run by the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it &apos;s practically your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to log in with Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed to Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will appear in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module is exp@@ orting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for two times , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which indicates the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at the moment , you will need no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pressed once you have set any other options . using this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button starts the upload of the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r Server . &quot;
&quot; the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a , which are added to the image as tags during the upload . &quot;
&quot; with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as a private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the Change option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation right now . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image , and the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to create a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a lane file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have trace data from a location for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then press the cor@@ relations button to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog box coordinates the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map by and after . select the respective region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Lead this time and again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here &apos;s a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool for exp@@ orting a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 , in order to enable the best internation@@ alization . &quot;
the panel has four tab@@ s where the settings can be customized . the tab selection allows you to select all albums which are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory .
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program noti@@ fications to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically be started to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom or p@@ anning . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for a quick image show and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses in quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of color information takes place . this can also be found in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module is currently not a documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not to write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Enco@@ der Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG Co@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the images you want to pack into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow . &quot;
the images you selected will then be listed under picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list .
&quot; if you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is fixed below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your preferences , you can start drinking a coffee quickly or in all tranqu@@ ill@@ ity and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages using the button Settings on the right bottom . &quot;
&quot; the printer assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , to improve or print out the Gim@@ p module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original amount of Him is : do not expect the same results created as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file that is to be converted and start the module . the raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have an effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise continue using the JPEG format , you should not choose the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata stored in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ ize in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio changes with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images in advance .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will appear with the images you have selected . to add images you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview on the right is shown . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of e @-@ mails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and each time used until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the closing button , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced slideshow , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transfer option in the presentation enables very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the option fil@@ en@@ ame tells you that the file name of the images in the left lower corner will appear during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose the images displayed in a random order . so it &apos;s not the order of the pictures used in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly select a different effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during slideshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn you on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the preceding and next image and stop slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have posted your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now present in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group head@@ words entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have submitted your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are shown . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , which also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button that is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category separately . &quot;
&quot; in order to do this , you need to open the image view window ( described in detail ) and in the context menu you can select the image viewer . in the view window , you can customize the image to suit your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the Find dialog in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog can be viewed on the picture once more . &quot;
&quot; you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be a part of the total date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can search all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , start the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or choose from the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; Demo . then some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed list view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview view ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you browse the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; gives you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version that you can create through the menu File HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the moment and a description , which will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created which can be seen on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . by doing so , you can avoid that information is displayed that the viewer is also without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not received specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can scan your images with lower resolution , which leads to a lesser transfer time . if it wants to get a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the various folders and the URL where your site is saved . &quot;
&quot; best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these really all are visible to viewers . if you want to select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must copy them manually . so that the import function , see , correct , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings above have all three related to base folders and URLs . in this case , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , Cre@@ ate . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files , will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for Export Pictures will be described , which you can export via the File menu File ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; with the manual option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Imp@@ orting ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in detail . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons belonging to the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can match the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to search and view images : when you see pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) Fes@@ tive information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the search and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos too . in many places in this manual it is talking about pictures , but often this includes videos too . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of your pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
&quot; set up menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual , you will see the different settings . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different icons with which you can preview settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as stated in . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available to you for setting up the member groups . with the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin Interface . more information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the module yourself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using these on your own images . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , is therefore all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; apart from the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then every entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category people , you will use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so whether you have selected people to view and share it with the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select modules to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a tool@@ bar and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes may be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on the reloc@@ ating of images within the list . for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , therefore , that the names used upwards are moved to find and assign persons more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon to sort by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item additional entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . in order to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon will appear . &quot;
&quot; in the Comment dialog &apos;s context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort this into a sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you just sort your categories in alphabe@@ tical order . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by drag@@ ging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you have no filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Edit selection in the Edit menu . now , the window will appear that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images anywhere , so that you can record the pictures somewhere , so that you can record them in the database index . in the picture , you see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails will show you the preview of these images . however , you cannot view these pictures with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it supports up to now not to ask you to insert the respective CD . so if you want to avoid h@@ ass@@ le , how to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all the pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who wish to make you un@@ accessible to others and click on the current view locked in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu entry Any@@ thing out of the current view . &quot;
&quot; when you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the Menu Add images , eliminating all the images you &apos;ve locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password , which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu Privacy . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on one hand , all pictures on the hard disk and on the other one can access or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you have about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag and drop it in a different way . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the information box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full@@ screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
&quot; when you are using the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply pull up a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus key zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the dot key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the Equ@@ ity@@ Button puts the zoom so that each pixel corresponding to the screen represents one pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are .
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you view images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the picture and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to mark only the image and view more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while you watch them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to display categories in the preview view , then you can add characteristics to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature selected after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in order to view the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image painting from the context menu . to end the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire modes views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click either on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the menu Insert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and re @-@ click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the Property View and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is shown in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility stage as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object , or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility stage smaller or equal to the level chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window dressing or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as you like . you can also store multiple windows arrangements and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under an existing view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to assign multiple views to each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then change between views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window dressing is floating views : views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the start to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the An@@ alog bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ fas@@ cia strip . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with the window dressing window ... Save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window dressing under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ame it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written , it was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a rendering mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the symbol The render settings in the tool@@ bar or in View R@@ ender modes , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each rendering mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense but a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the rendering properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super sampling . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a lat@@ tice of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it comp@@ utes diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this tab , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly completed , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ k@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . here you can set the path to your document and version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wi@@ re@@ model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you display a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a wooden board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you display the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is displayed in a wooden board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ness , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more precisely data on parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can modify existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window dressing window , explains how to create and store window arrangements . &quot;
the drop down of standard window dressing : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window dressing for the start of the program .
the list of existing window arrangements displays all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to create adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the button Add and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ ors the window under the existing window , with map view you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result , you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D @-@ program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed all error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window dressing : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this tutorial , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . now , you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the view of the scene from the view of the camera shows you , in particular , the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the content of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the App@@ ly or the En@@ ter button , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert fin@@ ite bodies ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : choose the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press App@@ ly or En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited end@@ point . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you view the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how to paste the object . please select the first sub object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can view the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a weak black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment . always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on pre@@ viewing . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and ball in the preview , click App@@ ly on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview button . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now by clicking on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . in the object tree you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; each time in the object tree , select in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
this step should be executed just as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have already understood . the ball is just as easy to create as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the En@@ ter or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground for one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; first of all , select sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ments . click on the Pig@@ ment button , then select Pat@@ tern@@ ed and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med finishes , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and hopefully you have learned so much , which you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer has hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and breaking the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog can affect the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have edited the edit item .
&quot; save the current window dressing , and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog for changing keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
&quot; a dump map is a way to pre@@ tend rough surfaces , without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geometric shapes , which you can use as modules : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ base , by applying an image file as color chart . &quot;
&amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
pictures can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small entry field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box &amp; ball show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation from &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still view the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ball show ; when ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can create &amp; ball show , so that only some of the file types can be displayed that can display the program as well . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . &quot;
&quot; change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation from &amp; ball show ; in the flash@@ cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays big icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
&quot; closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; will also be closed , if no browser window is open anymore . &quot;
view the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will contain a link to reports of problems and desires . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to encourage you to join the user @-@ mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings you need to set the show@@ photo set in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
&quot; in the exposure indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you are supposed to display , in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view them in image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes scanning and storing images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes scanning and storing images . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command kan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel and quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not cover these options .
&quot; to get an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the complete preview in the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and drag@@ ons will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button Settings , the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; channels ; images can be saved . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; these automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the option Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically saving images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is recorded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . when choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; output .

the global keyboard short@@ cut can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and setting Global keyboard short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you can possibly set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts work . this will make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general features that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; d dialog --@@ Ans@@ wer@@ case &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should include any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages enable the output of external programs and commands . for this , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of each script . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change indicates that a new piece is being played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b , asking for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example , the metadata or the unit length ) . &quot;
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ian paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry has been cli@@ cked . in order to add your own entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P Fun@@ ction d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ian ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.@@ g . this includes saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with a wide array of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Scrip@@ ts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you &apos;re looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if you decide to make the decision still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be enabled or de@@ activated for compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . please refer to the System Requirements section for details . &quot;
&quot; you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; in addition , the player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available , if and Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; design : this function is only available , if and Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if and Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled . mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
&quot; save the playlist while moving , save the current playlist automatically when loading &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while ending . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing the piece , make sure that the play@@ lists window stays open / un@@ rolled to keep the current play in the visible window area . &quot;
switching to context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can adjust the look &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn Scrip@@ ts , the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;

&quot; set on the On @-@ screen display allows you to set up the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check@@ box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used . &quot;
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers are able to activate further settings in this map .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse the sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the one @-@ crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . moreover , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists added to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will the host enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the card file last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile , so you can use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs contained therein because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD require your window managers to comply with the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will therefore work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
most of the time it is that tag@@ lib become abnormal when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of them are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if such , for example , Amar@@ ok ; but with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable autom@@ . shut off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens to a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info , but do not label as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; doesn &apos;t exist &apos; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some ways . most installation problems are easiest with the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; LiveZilla is a great software , it has a lot of features , that , without any doubt , help our organization to have a close and ... &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a empty playlist will appear . how do you get pieces of music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start -@@ sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist needs to be displayed in the playlist . click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title bar of the playlist and select column review . you can also select the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select From playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let it fall there just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , you can save the playlist playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; presum@@ ably , the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check out lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used a back@@ end independent approach so the real question needs to support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which the default setting does not include any MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously playback audio . this can be achieved using a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in finding the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to give a different sink ( e.g. floor sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X. There are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok in advance ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &quot;
&quot; please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. If you have a list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have wo@@ ken up by the gentle sounds of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of running play : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows separated . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button creates a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the En@@ ter after a search in the playlist the first search result is played and the search reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers should be shown .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; select a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic enco@@ ding , take files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual review on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can add the review for a piece yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the valuation of a piece just as all the other attributes , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : select review or edit F2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan , which is not compatible with the short @-@ term Amar@@ ok plan . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . des@@ elect the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . choose settings tool@@ bars ... and make the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; Con@@ quer@@ ors navigation range allows you to monitor and control Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in the kon@@ quer@@ or , start kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click on the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the pop @-@ up menu . &quot;
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and also a lot of bug reports . &quot;
presum@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to recon@@ figure and install Amar@@ ok .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I consider the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How to fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad module is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed beside G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; set up Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output will give you the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported further . you may of course like to take this issue into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed advisor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like to update your collection afterwards , or just don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will help you . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag with the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can only save the remaining appropriate entries . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist playlist under save . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add this to the playlist browser . if the playlist is contained in the folders of your collection and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then you &apos;ll find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning feature is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&quot; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages over a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it has a player window with the most important functions . &quot;

&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the play buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . with playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to display the E@@ quali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the E@@ quali@@ zer check@@ box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player . however , don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist itself can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its look can be adapted with the help of context browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window will drop off . the information presented there is now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information in the statistics window can also be viewed ( extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music window displays information about the current play , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current play . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; to view covers images in the context browser , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context @-@ browser will also display covers images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the interpreter , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download with the help of self written script texts from other web pages . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search for google.com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group interpre@@ ts - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group Performer / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and this is the best view of your collection . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below Various Artists . &quot;
&quot; group performer / year - Album - sort by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the performer is ignored .
group genre / performer - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by performer .
&quot; group Genre / Performer / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing according to your needs . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view . you can find hints for using this filter in the section about the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter there is a drop down box with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select your total collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This is the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as playlist . you &apos;re asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queu@@ es for transfer to the media player . see the section about the Media Player Browser section for more details .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn to CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed this option is not shown .
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the compilation album - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among various artists . &quot;
&quot; raising a compilation @-@ marking - Change a compilation of marked album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown with different performers , but again under the related artist . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes handling with many play@@ lists quite easy . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will need to find the pieces on your iPod by performer in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and release them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and dis@@ solve the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar where you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , if you enter : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop the music from there to the music box . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ ending of files can be difficult by simply dro@@ pping down . in the case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : thus , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist will contain all the pieces attached to you . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the items with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will include entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you provide a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something search for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax versions after loading . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the bad comment . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then click on the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the left . right next to it , you will find playlist , empty , and m@@ asked playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow undo and restore . so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the center of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu , you can set up your configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , play@@ lists and volume controls . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars there ... Select . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and des@@ elect the status bar option in general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . &quot;
click on this entry opens the visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures . you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what should be shown in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management got your big suit in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which you play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the sequence of pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ valent ( details to set up these will follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces during playback .
adds tracks based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
&quot; double click on the playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Download . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes , random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist has to be added at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled first at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated via the same menu entry . &quot;
&quot; the new button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist , and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist , and edit the playlist , and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot;
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be heard twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while playing songs . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces played , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow their own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be cleared then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog box visu@@ alization plug @-@ in is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . in order to understand the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 &apos;s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality when re @-@ enco@@ ding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide will show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . now you see a dialog box that looks like this or something like that : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original image is entered into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be fired . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : burning all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all features , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; has , and extends these functions even . hence , choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ free and professional audio enco@@ ding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , layer II , and layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; m@@ peg , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise a new fil@@ en@@ ame will be asked . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save is shown with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call save for every single project file .
&quot; when a project changes and has not been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can then cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will request for any un@@ saved project , which will happen , just as if you have called for each project file closing . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do , as if you have called file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select from the appearing dialog files to add to the project . that has the same effect as if you have the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above what is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only bl@@ ends the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn at some point later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can only create a copy of a DVD which you can then burn at some@@ time later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . converting / com@@ min@@ ating DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog to format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD vs. R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported currently , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the button button .
&quot; a previously read DVD video can be converted . this dialog box will typically appear after reading a DVD in the Table of Content , but can also be used all @-@ in . it contains information about the selected video , enco@@ ding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is ti@@ cked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not ti@@ cked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the disk or disc@@ ard the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content View allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ board is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the keys for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keys to it further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on th@@ ief . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task is crucial , which of the enclosed programs will give you a preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Dat@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ worthy ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String parent ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; file selection for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , simply audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the enco@@ der which is installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders that enco@@ des these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) as standard ( These enco@@ der packages need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored into WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copies protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling to read a &amp; CD will be explained later . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will stum@@ ble frequently in the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step , for example , there are more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request the CD @-@ data in accordance with the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der was configured in the enco@@ der settings tab in the setup directory - the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the standard . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the enco@@ der settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog box of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ ders , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here , you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you select the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . apart from FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that may lose information by means of data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be listened to on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . &quot;
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = this setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a titanium . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ ols . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed and used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where individuals can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download the information instead of themselves into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( with the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from CD &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; whoever wants to know more precisely , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . further information about enco@@ ders are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this may have many causes . check the setup of device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reader real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; please check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step for example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine since it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD ; what each exit &amp; CD has to be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will not be able to change it at any time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
&quot; the device name is given to the reading program , so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read . &quot;
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card @-@ card general settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be as loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information is missing for generating key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second choice field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , you can easily change the directory name / file name or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database first . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first one . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load between the machines is distributed . however , this setting will work first . &quot;
&quot; both function as equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ oting the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there may be more luck with protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient . &quot;
just take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously reading pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? simultaneous reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so just try it yourself . &quot;
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not ti@@ cked , the files are created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ c@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of wa@@ v files at the same time : with a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , it is possible to try more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD takes on the hard disk . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was created in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually input data instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD needs to be inserted ; in the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , go to the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot , the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ell per song , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. all words with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats .
&quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the row with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries in the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece off or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection to read the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the entries and follow what runs out . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is read straight to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format .@@ MP3 . there@@ with , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you know with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be customized to suit your needs , the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step for example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first starting time of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should continue from this blank screen ( especially if at the time of program start there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; may it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N to fetch , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke Player by &amp; k@@ de . besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ mi@@ di players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa will be included as soon as a sequ@@ encer is supported . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; drop every MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards in order to save text into MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) .
&quot; if you end &amp; k@@ de ; end playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; drop windows . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the item to play from the menu piece or press the space key . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played together . )
&quot; once &amp; mid ; play one piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the piece , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space button while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics events and others both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event sty@@ p is automatically retri@@ eved that a song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually set up the kar@@ aoke text , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . these are played according to the series . in this section , how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find them in the collection under the dot . click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the counter@@ s in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the Next Song button , select the next song from the menu piece or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; in order to jump back a song , select the Pre@@ y piece , the item selection from the menu piece or press the arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map briefly transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI Map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ LE ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ Ma@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence possesses a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ Ma@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ Ma@@ P &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI can be shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a shot ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ al instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ Ma@@ P section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map tones to the percussion channel . look at the included key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to change the first and second channel , simply do this in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option may be useful in order to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then first for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI Map , just open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a number of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see what sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the View channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ Sch@@ mid ; &apos;s ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I am open on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or go to ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or go to ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) just in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn the settings Autom@@ atically add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the settings Autom@@ atically add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , me anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and I don &apos;t want to make money for anyone . I would like to stress that I am only talking about this because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , fault notification or even just a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web which give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .html . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is shown . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select the playlist with playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without paying the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation during starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 with option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will follow the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end of the animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a startup animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ ml &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a flash is played using the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be inserted into the video player for YouTube in the playlist .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE should be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be seen , the device must be used to use the device and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recor@@ ders ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is used in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the enco@@ ding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; as the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; in the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there any hint how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I &apos;m playing from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to run root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts up slowly and why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is obsol@@ ete , k@@ x@@ ine@@ player will automatically need the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to refer to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the lin@@ ux distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact should be made via the K@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you want to compile a file , please refer to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; K@@ ile ; the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn about its options , the guide should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic rendering is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; here only a good over@@ sight to &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book to it . to rule &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for creating the document . some may also be made to the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , Article ( DIN ) , Article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
coding : hereby the character enco@@ ding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t need to worry about it . this is just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( for example \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile , this function automatically generates a command line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the K@@ ile menu ; this function can be de@@ activated in the menu ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the lowest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source . &quot;
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the same output from &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing and converting DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
&quot; when looking back , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is cli@@ cked in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the default text is cli@@ cked at the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . using a master document simpli@@ fies the work with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is available at &quot; &quot; n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â ¬ &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection boxes were developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the further for further information is for items such as tags , buttons or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a defined term ( selection above a selection box possible ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a drop @-@ down list with literary inputs is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name is used for setting the font sizes . you can set the font sizes for the main text , the top notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch to hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , it can also happen later in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the button for quick construction . &quot;
&quot; the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile , the storage automatically delet@@ es . &quot;
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , the logging should be searched for errors . when using quick construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few sources should have another font . &quot;
the changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no description ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , there may be certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , vacuum pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the c@@ lic print and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } in ital@@ ics .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background has been presented for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; label language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile follows . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . &quot;
&quot; once the document is viewed , editor view or C@@ trl @-@ E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( e e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion can begin in known other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; files . you just need to set up Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools building will be selected .
&quot; in order to perform the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and can be cli@@ cked to the appropriate place in the DVI ; the viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; K@@ ile ; open and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; defined as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; should an error occur when using the fast @-@ build of the &amp; DVI ; if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file displays the error source in the source code . in the editor , the buttons are used as La@@ Te@@ X Error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between errors . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the fault line . &quot;
&quot; once clicking on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be re@@ written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used to quickly create a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are sub@@ stituted : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by typ@@ ing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created you have to take the following steps :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and retri@@ eving from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn about its possibilities , the hand@@ book should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile can start working there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical and lat@@ ex ; command reference that can be called over the menu La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; they can be used as well as their syntax .
&quot; double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; -@@ word . this means that in this way , clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with knot@@ ted Shift , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search for different types of source code and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex commands differ from the normal text and the mathematical form@@ ulas are distinguished by another colour . &quot;
many wiz@@ ards can capture additional spr@@ ing@@ marks . these include a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ n@@ tr@@ Ã © Edit Ski@@ ps or the corresponding Keys allow the jump to the next or last spr@@ ing@@ mark . this is also highlighted by this jump @-@ mark so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character .
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already providing outstanding features , they have been added to &amp; K@@ ile ; there are always many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; K@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selection , the following commands for selection are included : &quot;
&quot; a complete paragraph ( group of rows , which contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with clear lines ( like in other tex@@ te@@ di@@ tors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also ends with a tick ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the keys . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove , the following commands are contained in the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit item paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for further commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to create the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is present before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , the cur@@ sor is spra@@ yed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , quickly the over@@ sight can be lost . this command closes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from the editing environment .
this command is sent to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the sh@@ orn close cl@@ asp . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # is spra@@ yed at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; with the input of many ne@@ sted sk@@ inn@@ ed groups stap@@ les , quickly the above overview can be lost . this command closes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups cannot be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy reference marks are used as GÃ ¤ n@@ se@@ duc@@ ts . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; used for two simple application marks . also for the ending of the application , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and includes two closing reference marks for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double suits can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; for Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; K@@ ile ; not just a line break , but at the same time the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab in the next line . although this tab is not the same , for &amp; K@@ ile ; some spaces for columns position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already providing a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; K@@ ile ; three different modes are implemented ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two can be set up for automatic adjustment . all these modes can be set up for automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { Environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { Environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , by this way , it is possible to shrink the list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed from &amp; K@@ ile ; also jump marks can be captured , so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible using editing spr@@ ing@@ marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste spr@@ ing@@ mark and the desired parameters can then be found . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile , set up ... K@@ ile ; can make settings to these lists . you can select different W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not necessary for the performance of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the output mode will result in a large list with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for accompl@@ ishing the environment . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete set @-@ up mode , the environment or key Alt + Shift key Space button , the command to exit the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the entry button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile , realize that it is a listing environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile , set up ... K@@ ile ; can make settings to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter Mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be completed with ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word is prec@@ eded by the menu , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; big W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter are not helpful for automatic handling . however , it was found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; K@@ ile ; the comprehen@@ sion for all already written W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the K@@ ile Settings ... K@@ ile can be fully switched off . here , the threshold value for the display can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the complete folder files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphic formats , the sections should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be re@@ arranged and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menus , create compile , create conversion and create views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by Alt ; 4 ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file , and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will open . &quot;
a new project is about the new project . here the following information is asked for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the exec@@ utions of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed yet and can be modified in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile is a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; ly@@ live ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . it contains a documentation for the contained par@@ c@@ els and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results will be displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the operator of the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be found on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ similar systems . &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project ; thus &amp; K@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ;
&quot; many thanks to those who are looking for the progress of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project aiming and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; current information about the contribut@@ ors are available in the Men@@ Ã ¼ ller &amp; K@@ ile . &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . the signature @-@ line interface allows you to create random signature or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random signature , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many sig@@ natures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sig@@ natures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day you use different sig@@ natures , as with the random Sig@@ natures you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you a blank sig@@ natures ; in the Sig@@ natures section you will receive a blank signature ; in the lower section , click your new signature . signature : Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org http : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org http : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; you can create any number of sig@@ natures . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use email private or professional , there are always plenty of sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select them first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text hand in the main window is offset to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use comp@@ atri@@ ots as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as sub@@ strate . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentary worked , knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . do we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked and finished the symbol for the XML processor ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in a war@@ y working folder , then leave the current job folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how useful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they just leave the current job folder . if not , then select up @-@ to @-@ date working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then , leave the current file easily . if not , delete the file at the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check option . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of Defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , the file is normally stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately profit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone is using the counter@@ s into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin with the menu plugin Edit . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all the plugins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the statement of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pus@@ hes the button as pressed . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears bold according to which you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something takes place . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event Ac@@ tions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that later , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that takes a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list selected in the recipient list . address sat may be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see where you will set up such ladder .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note that note is simple . it can be either selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , with the nickname of the defined top @-@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the braces and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog stretches over several pages that are treated after each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . entries are :
&quot; large / low @-@ capit@@ alization of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal Groß / Minor , attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close tags : when attached , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
&quot; automatically refres@@ h the start and end tag : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic sub@@ stitution of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) but this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the default window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / dependen@@ cies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message section is used for controlling the possibility to adver@@ tise warnings by hooks of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL . it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the section structure tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the actu@@ alization frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause short@@ cut is different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plugins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; read @-@ only mode &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin ref@@ uses the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the given information is correct . pick out allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , bug hunting has been completely new developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been adjusted , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plugin with to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is activated by default , when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal cases it does not have to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger is exec@@ uting the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include files . &quot;
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the statement and go back to the next , as if there were the current ones . &quot;
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your needs and how you can help to become better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; abilities such as car completion and K@@ not@@ enb@@ aum . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contain handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , to insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags to a document without the risk of a cur@@ sor . &quot;
tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag folder bears the name of the description language and version . ( for example : html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only be used once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used for reaching source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once . it is an element type element .
defines the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a single element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration starts : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ ch@@ ained and closed properly .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but watch &amp; lt ; symbols . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is shown above in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not yet available . currently the check is done only when loading the tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following example for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following example , an example for a functioning family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = sol@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set with settings actions ... click New action to create the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut , assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the various look in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script is used . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us input ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output , error messages , to the default output output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create its own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that you can input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Show other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the tag starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually as loose , stiff , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some custom@@ ary &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or you should set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog via settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element , which is to be added to tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; if the new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . &quot;
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like best . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP script for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to have an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = func@@ tions@@ .html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for designing the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; if you are certain that they are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places , there is an Email @-@ send menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start clicking OK . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree will be started . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signature . if integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not yet from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that the following dialog appears :
&quot; target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder . &quot;
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ Line : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are stored for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is selected globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the project tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building blocks , the flash@@ cards with information and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; you can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card holders , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , ski@@ p to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the text under the mouse cur@@ sor , help the word under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , when the string is lab@@ eled under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown .
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and browse them . in the representation with card holders are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu shown . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . more to templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the information available for a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ hing of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other building blocks . with it , many attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system that is aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two card holders at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . they display on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the tool@@ bars of tool@@ bars are the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , give . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , which has already developed someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to extend as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; with self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , autom@@ ating almost every task is possible . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase dramatically . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta . the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more details in detail is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; after inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; description , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; on and off the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated , as soon as you switch to the structure tree . &quot;
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries forecast or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to paste files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or Project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set up by setting actions . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access them . see in . &quot;
load one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu bar that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it . click on the activated plugins off . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax mode for the current file . the list of available lifting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes might need time or unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web@@ browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or alter them and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is saved in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except for processing local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and as default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; be hoo@@ ked when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection for good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Project Properties in the sub@@ window profiles or using the Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are completely ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case the troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as display a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing one &apos;s own vision for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ specified event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced right now . &quot;
to open another project select project ... from the Project Project or the Project File open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if you want changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave similarly , however the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk save option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the server name to which files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de , and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . usually , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project Tool@@ bar Project or Project Tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to handle tool@@ bars . the addition of tool@@ bars is discussed below in the Add tool@@ bar section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either using the contex@@ tual menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , it can ren@@ ame tool@@ bars or create tool@@ bars where you can specify which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action will be shown , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set up actions ..
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code escal@@ opes and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; basically use templates like a usual fil@@ esystem with exp@@ and@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the inventory tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary templates are usually inserted into documents by short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in pre @-@ stock under global templates . further information on the Templ@@ ate Tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more special documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a commentary on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure according to si@@ eves ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template save As a local template ... &quot;
&quot; once that is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre @-@ repository under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template , save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or paste over the kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure a name for the template . by default , it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically link with &amp; PHP ; shape , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
template structure in sub @-@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
&quot; in order to define the behaviour of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for anything other than the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be set in such a way , templates would appear in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , one is likely to be found in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; allows a previous or later text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , allowing for copying contents templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for the addition of folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source code editor using the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cur@@ sor will appear . then you can edit and return to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor of a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ itt of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still needed . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 enables the active cur@@ sor to move the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via Settings Qu@@ anta ... After choosing V@@ PL ; View you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically .
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties can be chosen . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows modification of the contents e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file opening button , selecting the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cur@@ sor is possible as in a text processing , by moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of return button or removal paste . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via tool@@ bars , such as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , needs to be removed any other anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists wiz@@ ard are disabled . later , they will work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be pursued . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparison . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time at many places the ind@@ entation had corrected . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no cl@@ ue to the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a full @-@ value file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons are working independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make typ@@ ing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der@@ 2 Fol@@ der folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o destination folders
&quot; opening dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A to the other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Configuration button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop by a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just drag text into a comparison window . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one can see the color which file distingu@@ ishes . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) . &quot;
&quot; if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding issue : , the file name and &#91; ge@@ aring &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict of manually resolved . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also indicate a jump in the position in the windows where the group &apos;s start is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left a black bar appears .
&quot; sometimes , there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manually editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking you might copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , low , page on , page , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , conflict between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line end of source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays scripts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab token is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the return of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the manual into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer for saving . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others may look identical to a new@@ line character , but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ an @-@ page comparison may look identical , though they are treated differently . during mer@@ ging , this option must be de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; this option is disabled in default . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; , &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; looking intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also includes conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation to compare list and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original app@@ r . if already a such backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to exit and restart it , so that the change will be active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set there globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be configured separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; the selection boxes for the enco@@ ding appear a short note , which is the local enco@@ ding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the enco@@ ding is individually adjustable for each file , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you would prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , you consider the differences and then choose ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . you can use this function for example to cut @-@ out distur@@ bing parts or to correct ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only in line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . any input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this command line for line comparison to convert the typ@@ ing in upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a succ@@ ul@@ ary expression of the characters found on each string . the \ \ 1 in the translation string refers to the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ Key@@ word generated text $ . now a pre @-@ processing command is required for line comparison : the \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ E@@ very character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / sub@@ stitution / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l just ( and ) without the prec@@ eded &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging , and the further operations will only change the data that the line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hides differences , you acci@@ dentally can &apos;t notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
... can simul@@ ate the merge and show the simulated changes without actually performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you need to specify only folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no destination folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will find a small message window about the current progress . &quot;
&quot; if the scanning of the file is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions and all sub@@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened and / or folded .
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . for folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist the merge cannot be started .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are syn@@ ced active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merge ( unsure ) is checked , then examines &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merge one file is processed after the other . it status column displays finished when mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparative method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the matching actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified destination folders , then in the three folder merge mode C will be used as the target , with the two @-@ folder merge , B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all the entries : select directory merge and continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to just execute the current item or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if the conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears to indicate the defective elements . they can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all the entries , a dialog box appears with the options Th@@ row , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen , without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re done with a file , select another directory merge , continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue your work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , it leaves &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the item or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually merged , the entries ( in the current session ) will not be noticed again . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be viewed as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called Directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that match the pattern specified are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns are entered with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders don &apos;t have to comply with this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig@@ . * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig@@ . * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a prec@@ eded dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a link to a folder containing a link on itself would result in an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster to compare the date of change and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the Con@@ fi@@ dence Date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this may be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; enables syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be proposed as action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and get the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension , this will also affect the normal merge of individual files , not just the merge of entire folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible to the merge of single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the option Directory &amp; Text@@ pane to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the folder and text windows between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also run a single file directly without starting the folder . as soon as you save the result , the current file will be saved and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be aware of :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished , whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change from the original devi@@ ate . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently used as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts at first the built @-@ in differences observer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if applied as K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then it starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . additionally , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 is executed as part , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or matching folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can be merged like the diff@@ 3 program from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to it .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably not shared the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default setting configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines will appear next to each other , this is is liable but this is is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that might store this information . &quot;
the effort was too large to date . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text a different editor should be used .
&quot; after removing text , suddenly , no sr@@ c has been removed ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you have to re @-@ read the folder with the function Update after changes to these options . )
&quot; if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is down@@ lighted . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual desktop environments . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , change them , or move them . this works both inside a working area and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other areas of work . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when clicking on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager up ... and finish . if however , click on an application inside of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on desktop and ending . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktop environments . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed along with name , the names are provided with ord@@ al numbers , eg ; 1st work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty desktop spaces will be displayed to allow their choice . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with its default symbol and pixel map displays a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window is determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n ra@@ ster , as made of p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with their content . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set up sel@@ ector switch ... allow dialog settings to appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or assign yourself to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as pic@@ tured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is shown as magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to make a selected screen area in the enlar@@ ging window ( select window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ not ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; push key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays firmly and only move the bottom right corner . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save into a file , copy it into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
start / stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be shown in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your inserted short@@ cuts to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and crus@@ hing &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use a magni@@ fier , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the plain print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people from using : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , as soon as the cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s Syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and those of any mouse click . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor res@@ ides for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who are suffering from the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which any mouse click can em@@ ulate pain . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and assi@@ sts so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere charge of the mouse pain . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pains avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart move is enabled , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after it em@@ ulated pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the move before releasing the mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you quickly get used to it . &quot;
this residence time must reach after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; if intel@@ li@@ ent moves on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is shut down , the mouse button is waiting again , if the mouse clicks without moving the mouse over time . &quot;
&quot; this feature activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . this moves are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , will be &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; Start . this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to automatically start a program . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the last press release . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with Pre@@ ferences . in particular , the smart shifting should first be turned off . if you then get used to the automatic click , you can later add the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; first you should make aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or at places in the browser window , which do not show a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse h@@ emisph@@ ere . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scr@@ ape the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you use the intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end the operation by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can manually execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the mouse click and set the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but leave the mouse on a neutral field of desktop when you want to make a keyboard . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus , and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to use this way to copy it into the clip@@ board or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and click the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this way , each time , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button is playing a sound like a mouse click . you know exactly when when the smart move begins the im@@ position time . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window has to be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome , and which causes pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to have a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and setting with the mouse can also be done . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which mu@@ te users can speak to their computers for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history pro@@ positions that are to be talked again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that is later used for voice output . for more details , refer to the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text passages book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you define the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only properly spell words can be recorded in words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a storage memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have a mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the course memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... Open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two map cards , voice output and settings , the words of words and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field you specify the character enco@@ ding , which will be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed down as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation about your language generator . see App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the t@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of In stock , the selected text passage is directly spoken and inserted in the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected passage will only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second choice field closing the editing window for text@@ book text@@ book , you can choose whether the text@@ book @-@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; when you select changes , the text@@ book book is not saved . if you select changes , then the text@@ book book is not saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for the words of words . &quot;
&quot; with buttons right on the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ d ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then queries which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these dic@@ tion@@ aries should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly translated words automatically inserts into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new passages or books or del@@ eting selected passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text will be cut and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a movable tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is ordered directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow strip is shown in the lower part of the main window with cl@@ ues about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sli@@ dable bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar above the editing window . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card card language output . ( see Settings dialog for Language Synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ jus . the voice output is then possible with one of the three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional sign has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complicated than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setup of the language generator is performed only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with people who cannot speak text by the computer . a list of already spoken pro@@ positions is saved , which the user can always release new editions . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found on help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows every application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; to voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities , too . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; speech output is performed by speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the generation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .
&quot; supports Speech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech mark@@ up @-@ met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service from &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list , you can subscribe to the list via https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust properly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card is displayed in general . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you run &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher will otherwise use the standard speaker . &quot;
different actors for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer @-@ expected queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card company spokes@@ person in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card will be displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already appointed speakers appear in this list . the preferred spokes@@ persons appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines also its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls vote to choose from . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; go . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; please click on the map tab to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card carrier in general to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card will be shown , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the preview is completed . &quot;
&quot; the buttons in this series allow you to start , break , stop and record text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one job . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card carrier General and check out voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read before , and select the text editor in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML files and other invisible stamps are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read before , and select the text editor in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you of events defined by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up a message in which your nickname occurs when in an IR@@ C channel your nickname will appear . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required for normal work .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before he is sent to the speech speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who has just entered the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order you get from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the issue of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reading , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string replac@@ ements replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation , or by mail ; in a better understandable format . &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ formers have a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to convert from a format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation by &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can send assignments depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker , for example , if you have a female voice on the card card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ i@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter is not enabled , it is not enabled and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following installation di@@ alogs are displayed below . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can select this name as required , it must only be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column returns . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the word selected or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . load a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl key . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you can only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; the string inser@@ tion filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the label filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the resol@@ ute package . &quot;
&quot; XML ; trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conversion . however , it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; gives a text to the filter , it is looking for a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties , which speci@@ fies the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help in the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; these synthes@@ iz@@ ers can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; the text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you enter
&quot; open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Window . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the so @-@ called speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Set@@ ting filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so SA@@ B@@ LE does not work at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ boys are spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character enco@@ ding option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices which have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package of k@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found at http : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
KT@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you wish to extend it for using another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; purchased from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility , or download the tar@@ ball currently created each night , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you run &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences . the user can leave pro@@ positions or statements , repeat , pause or break the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its sex female , it is used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click to add an Add @-@ on to the list , and to insert a speaker in the list , or click Edit , the card card spokes@@ person setup will be displayed below . for example , the set up of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details about modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in PAT@@ H , you will have to enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text that is given to the festival . for voices that are called &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is performed automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this gray , the voice you choose does not allow these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet established a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . &quot;
&quot; here , all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the currently processed sentence . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can go back or back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts are not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ d , click on the Audio Card Audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; lists of Screen Re@@ aders , warnings and messages are not displayed here . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled and compiled either without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 0m ; % of the double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll have to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this tab , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the Screen reader has been read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , anyone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text message is interrupted . if both sound sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory note is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice , the festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . with SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . by doing so , you can start or stop or stop orders from the map , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of limits recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add more pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition filters , but beginners will get off from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the setting up of the speech selection by trying out . switch on the speech selection and select text to read . switch on the speech selection , which spokes@@ man &amp; kt@@ ts ; turn off the speech selection , and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . you obviously need more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; then you can stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set of rules will automatically be set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut down , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation App@@ reci@@ ation App@@ ly compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and insert a tab@@ ul@@ atory sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit recognition filter re@@ tains the mark setting . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ noti@@ fications ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , you can paste it again by loading the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the interface selection list , you can over@@ write the voice settings for the application . the card chart is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card or@@ ator ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most suitable spokes@@ man showing all features of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who is closest to the originally set features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; here , select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , enter nothing . &quot;
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a prime feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language is above , if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one inserted in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the properties in the speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the selection button of standard speakers and then use for speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not receive back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashing down and cuts . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , you may have a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , fri@@ es &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; a message indicating : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is a problem that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the AL@@ SA project website ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t display this voice .
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio card there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be search@@ able via the PAT@@ H environment . some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive can also offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML re @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set the speech speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read Web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting the SS@@ ML to S@@ aber does not disc@@ ard the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same is true for the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a set of strings attached and now I can go to &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer can be passed on or go back . on the card im@@ print it is shown that the order exists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( dot , question mark , call@@ sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;

&quot; before you run &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , synthes@@ izer . then the Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; you need di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be used from German text Di@@ ph@@ s .
&quot; for this procedure , additional wr@@ apper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder will not be installed , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , Vo@@ ices . required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded .

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables the management of network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ pres@@ ets via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files , corresponding to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the hands @-@ on selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release status . by marking non @-@ recur@@ ring questions , the definition can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will then automatically set this option . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system management mode , you enter system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
&quot; the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the specified network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button of the button ... set up in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to view the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , the TCP / IP address must be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask is determined . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface for bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switch on a switched @-@ off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . disable an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; defines the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other networks . &quot;
&quot; if more than one network interface exists on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain address with the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS sol@@ ves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution part of the name resolution part of the name resolution enables easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons on or down in priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the host machine to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the machine to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit button .... &quot;
&quot; the list of known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; typically , the list contains names of names known as names , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add ... Add new alias dialog will appear .
&quot; enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known host has several alias names , press button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit ... Edi@@ ting the dialog box will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , in a &amp; Con@@ sole , the following command must be set . &quot;
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter you will find important information about basic network technology , in the second one will discuss all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; edi@@ table configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section may not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this is why this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the network administrator to assign a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
this part contains the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes modified dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is a different content in case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can happen .

&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of already set tasks and associated environmental variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , this will be used for all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened up and closed . &quot;
&quot; in case of a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not shown and under description will be disabled . &quot;
the environment variables appearing here set out the otherwise existing environment variables for all the tasks listed . if a de@@ activated variable is de@@ activated as a description .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the task folder . then go to Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can also right @-@ click on the task folder and click New ... Select or C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to start . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , click Select .... &quot;
&quot; select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot;
&quot; if you specify Mon@@ thly Day ( s ) as well as weekday ( s ) , the task is performed both at a suitable date and a suitable day of the week . for example , if you select 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be run on the 1st and 15th of the selected months regardless of the day of the week , and also every Sunday of the month , no matter what date they drop . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the cr@@ on@@ tab has been saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , first select the task to remove . then go to Edit Ex@@ traction . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; or press C@@ trl ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edit Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and select Copy , or press C@@ trl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first you have to cut or copy one into the clip@@ board . only then is inser@@ ting at all available . select the task folder . then go to Edit Insert . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and select Insert , or you press C@@ trl ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , first select one . then go to the Edit Change menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click the right mouse button on the task and change ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O. It will then edit the dialog task in which you can edit the task selected above . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the task to be cleared . then proceed to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select them , and determine the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked in@@ active in their description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the task with the right mouse button and select En@@ able . confirm that program name , parameters and description will be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to execute a task right away , select it and then proceed to edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the Edit New menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the variable folder and select New ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variables . you can also select a list of the most frequently used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the program to be called to another as the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes are made only when the cr@@ on@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to remove . then go to Edit Ex@@ tract . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edit Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the variable and select Copy , or press C@@ trl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert an environment variable , first you have to cut or copy one into the clip@@ board . only then is the option inser@@ ting at all . select the variable folder . then go to Edit Insert . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to be working . then go to Edit Modi@@ fy .... Altern@@ atively , you can click the variable with the right mouse button and Edit ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O .@@ It will then appear the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable an environment variable , select it , and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ation menu item . in case of a de@@ activated variable , de@@ activ@@ ates the description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the variable with the right mouse button and select En@@ able . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the cr@@ on@@ tab . select Save File menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are only then active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ dialog . if you choose fl@@ aps , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is accessible only to users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the cr@@ on@@ tab command to change the user &apos;s schedules . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar that offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second purpose was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be bound up by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; educ@@ ates the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ ills ; the pre @-@ sp@@ inning on the tape does not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t find it , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat files can be used , it has to be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a strip @-@ type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not match format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be done before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; however , flo@@ ppy tape drives do not pre@@ tend to format@@ ting the tape , but DAT drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape , all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you initiate the backup process , you need to select the files to be insured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a cro@@ chet . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save As ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the dialog box opens . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a cro@@ chet . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test is started , the dialog box appears . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore menu ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box appears for recovery . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will restart . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
&quot; as a result , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder . &quot;
&quot; for all files listed under backup files , only the files contained therein are stored on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to as@@ certain what files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files have been saved which have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; lt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation yet .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape recorder .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted and dat ; before the band is involved , the command mt load to the drive . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , you will automatically disc@@ ard the tape when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat files . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file folder .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited with the different protocol files .
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems encountered on their server . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start try and k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open the system protocol . instead , you will not have a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not with system administrator rights . the protocol files usually don &apos;t have permission to read under Linux . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or after set strings . the list of log lines will now be automatically changed , so that only log lines will be displayed that match the selected filter . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a different entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . in addition , select the process name in the protocol file system protocol , and also enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so you can show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color than record lines of the level critic . the color display of minutes lines can be shut down dialog dialog .
&quot; if you would like to display only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the To add new lines in the main window context menu to display all new additions to the protocol . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find more information about the source sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the System V In@@ it is fast becoming the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up at boot of the system in the &amp; Linux world . for this reason , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to reloc@@ ate a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installation and re@@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you will need a script for each system service that you want to start up to another run@@ level . system services include such things like Network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are based on r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script ends with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could have a user @-@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between running level@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or position ) . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you move them to a new level . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present there is no way to restore items thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so , be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it to clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sor@@ ter number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts to start anew . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , however , does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using any other distribution , please check that all configuration files are present ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) end up easily without notice if their configuration files are not present or installed in@@ correctly . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you will need to save them . either use the appropriate tool@@ bar icon or the storing item in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards are only displayed if you have enabled extended system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will appear where you can make individual settings . more card cards appear , if shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the card card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the Field File System with limited space limitation .
&quot; the map groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ alogue properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similar . &quot;
&quot; this module allows you to install the LI@@ LO System Selec@@ tor , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
