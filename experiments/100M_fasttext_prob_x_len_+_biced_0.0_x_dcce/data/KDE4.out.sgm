<seg id="5">"package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some extra features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making these easier available."</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">"to load these modules in the & konqueror, choose Settings Add-ons... Open the card tools and select the desired modules there."</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with standard settings modules from the package kde; addons. please note that more modules may be on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>

<seg id="12">"to use the DOM tree view in the & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root nodes of the document, example: documentations, all other nodes are subelements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different tool- and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists in showing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView, the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be easily recognised if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView may be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; an entry in the Trek display is a rectangle, which represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either display depth for easy recognition of nesting depth or representation of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is available at all, only if sufficient space is present or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and therefore display errors due to restrictions on the character of the Trek)."</seg>
<seg id="19">"with performance algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Tremitter in & FSView, this goal is not always kept. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as sharing the area of an entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses due to frame always advantageous the areas so square. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive divisions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry view in the area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="75">"photo 2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras which support an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and commits over the serial port this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. the Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the creation might be very slow."</seg>

<seg id="190">"the most widespread protection against power peaks is a surge protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy jokes and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember, however, that not every connector bar also includes an overvoltage protection."</seg>
<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, please ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system may also be protected. some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card."</seg>

<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate interference within the data streams. these errors remain unnoticed in normal filesystems.</seg>
<seg id="205">"even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year."</seg>
<seg id="206">"ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a lower level and can be highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows is available."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the topic comes to color management, everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of image processing workflows."</seg>

<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>

<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor because sRGB means that your monitor closes with sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="389">"the functions Normalizing, Absame, Automatic Different and Contrast expand from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction try automatically out of your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scans the luminous intensity over the whole picture so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"sometimes the balance equates very good results in enhancing the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either produces miracles in one image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic matching: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re-jiustizing of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digious; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is a little limited because of a colour gamut with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in rough mode, which works in the 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of copyright by Pawel T. Jochody. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="398">The target photos preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"right above, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown. the sum is called Luminancy."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your results depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade alignment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button presets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely distributed JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more disk space, calculating time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-toning can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consulted from the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under color correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use them for multiple photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digipack; tool colour effects gives you four colour effects, a solar thermal effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canopy filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarization, also called Sabatier, was an effect of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper from the additional light."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. an additional upliftment ultimately creates a negative picture that is not to be produced on photopaper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvet offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrasting edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repetitions the strength of the neon lights.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photo. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. you can experiment with the result using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than raising them. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound value correction for improving the exposure. even if dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of sliders for the purpose described here. concrete the three slides below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">"the simplest way to learn how to use it is to postpone the controls, and take care of how the picture changes."</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y axis is displayed. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controllers: the top for the dark sounds, the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color brushes can be used to preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values as interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as background while something else is in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons the set values can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digipack; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process has to be combined with minimal differences to a color point. this in turn causes sharp edges a bit of blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often applied to internal sharpening. on the other hand, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a field of sharpening already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry Corrigation sharpening sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening a picture will refocus. you can reach it via the menu entry Corrigation. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool to create a soft sign with the menu entry Corrigate plasticing and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the blurry mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats can create near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a channel of the filter to be applied. thus, areas with a soft switch between the tones are exempt from sharpening and therefore avoid flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool refocus refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected release filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing color in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the auss's folding. the auss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most of the pictures, the default value 1 should result in good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauze 'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your Unity Gauß is' sch '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or Gauß 'sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred mask produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, sharp masks always have to create artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurry. the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurry mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original non-sharp colour picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field of sharpening in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothes the blurry of the area of darkening to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"colour tints provide a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings for fine tuning, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed accounting p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions smooth and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should be given details so that no sharpening should be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD-Rauschen a high value can produce wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value matching the level of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 ranges from here.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle adjustment range da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as the greatest possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral steps [0.1, 10]: integral steps in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to leave it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time to take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>

<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the sub-window details and the subwindow advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is used per pixel and can wipe the image."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpening level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or smoking tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak diamond or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend you either change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gammatera tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more prefabricated, to increase. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the phase absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother if it is too high can occur."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>

<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixel is measured. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance from 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which then is used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which then is used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block."</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not light the entire sensor range. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharper effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's filesand the color or grey depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an equivalent transformation at a rough image without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction turns the transformation with a center filter onto a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controllers, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the level of light strengthening at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or by chance of compensating a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>

<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar tour effect, but flattens to the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grader corrects the distant corners opposed to that of the second degree. if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>

<seg id="592">"below the preview, you can set two parameters for film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add film granulation if you want to simulate the grain texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controls changes the quantity of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"as the filter color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digious; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver granules of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film granulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, granny sight, especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film composition effect on a black / white picture applied. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>

<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is with the (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the & digious; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a carbon sketch. the lines which define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. therefore, images whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved even further by adapting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digipack; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey and daring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>

<seg id="614">"with this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Unity Effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn."</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: wipes the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a centre point. this simulates the blurry a zoomic camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial roughness: wipes the image by turning the pixels at one point. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance urry: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion blurry: wipes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"softening: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or adding a warm and subtle annealing."</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: wipes the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the blur of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new."</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Beading.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image. this gives natural your images a wet look. it uses one by Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that is free to stay. if you then start the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflator is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation for an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was blown up by IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintained aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and load are used exactly to it. any single stamping for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflator is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Beading."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear default enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">"the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a commonly underestimated tool to compile a picture. to cut a photo, you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while moving the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are happy with the cut, use the clipping button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file save or file save in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the thumbnail area, you can change the rectangle size by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool According to aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool According to aspect ratio, uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you're using centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically centred the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"below in the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when you use the cutting tool next time, these settings will be displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The implementation assistance settings allow you to hide Help so that you can better put your pictures together. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity.</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden center: the golden center is a division dividing to different natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus shell or the flowering leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number of 1,618033988... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines if you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third elbow, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition results in the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden hedge. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangle. note that, unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not uniform triangles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object dynamically."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertically mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the Color button, you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool for turning a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates an image in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digious; image editing and tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is to use the function transformer cropping out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic trimming. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information to help you change the perspective:"</seg>

<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cropping out of image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal shear for example will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module through transformation Scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"drag your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear on the right of the thumbnail area."</seg>
<seg id="680">"your help will be a vertical and horizontal line. move your mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shear, the picture is a bit wiped out. for a single shot this effect is mostly negligible, but two shots testify twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>

<seg id="922">"in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not received specifically."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>

<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can match the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to search and view images: when you see pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because every pixel depends on the calculated colour values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a lattice of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it computes diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; add title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button identifier in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where individuals can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download the information instead of themselves into the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (with the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the machines."</seg>

<seg id="1537">"to save the selected WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoder. further information about encoders are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a shot (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gunshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussional instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KeyMaP section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map tones to the percussion channel. look at the included keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to change the first and second channel, simply do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for Keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>

<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a number of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kSchmid; 's)"</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparison. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time at many places the indentation had corrected. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3, could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3, almost into a full-value file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons are working independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps & kdiff3; in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make typing work by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder2 Folder folder kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 3 kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 3 -o destination folders</seg>

<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop by a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these features are, it would be a relatively large effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; just drag text into a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window, the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"if a difference is detected, one can see the color which file distinguishes. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparison window) also has an info line with the wording issue:, the file name and [gearing] if you edited the result. usually, it contains already text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict of manually resolved."</seg>

(this will also indicate a jump in the position in the windows where the group's start is otherwise not visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes, there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manually editing; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking you might copy and paste elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, low, page on, page, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also be used by other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture downward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. therefore, conflict between dissolved and unsolved conflicts must be distinguished."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if this is enabled, whatever you mark, will automatically copy to the clipboard and copy the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you might accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>

<seg id="2329">"when comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) save a car return sign '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, while others may look identical to a newline character, but then files with different sizes in the page-an-page comparison may look identical, though they are treated differently. during merging, this option must be deactivated."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"this option is disabled in default. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', ',', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still shown, but they are treated like white signs."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in default, this option is downlighted. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"looking intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful when white characters are less important in many files. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also includes conflict in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore ignoriere C / C + + comments."</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation to compare list and merge.</seg>

<seg id="2340">"the selection boxes for the encoding appear a short note, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)"</seg>
<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the encoding is individually adjustable for each file, even files with different coding can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for storing."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes, you consider the differences and then choose abruptly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as a pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to reboot the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)"</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your needs. you can use this function for example to cut-out disturbing parts or to correct indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only in line comparison. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your needs. any input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. the good news is, however, that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line for line comparison to convert the typing in uppercase: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a succulary expression of the characters found on each string. the\\ 1 in the translation string refers to the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $Keyword generated text $. now a pre-processing command is required for line comparison: the\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"the ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g'Every character between '[' and ']' is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually erased."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead, you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / regexp / substitution / SCHALTER 'Allerdings are different with perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl just (and) without the preceded'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">"the data according to the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and merging, and the further operations will only change the data that the line-like algorythmus can see."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes the text or hides differences, you accidentally can't notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" speech-dispatcher "works with a text."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of Screen-Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the Screen Reader is read, the retained orders will be resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">"messages have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; you can read a long text on a web page, you can with & kmouth; anyone who has just entered the room. & kmouth; notifications are also messages."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. any order you get from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the issue of longer texts, which do not have any special urgency."</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"string replacements replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions. by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversation, or by mail; in a better understandable format."</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues the text to the next filter."</seg>

<seg id="2949">"you can also select a different entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. in addition, select the process name in the protocol file system protocol, and also enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so you can show you & ksystemlog; all log lines sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color than record lines of the level critic. the color display of minutes lines can be shut down dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you would like to display only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command, such as the start of the Samba server."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can use the To add new lines in the main window context menu to display all new additions to the protocol."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & ksysv; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the System V Init is fast becoming the standard for controlling the program start-up at boot of the system in the & Linux world. for this reason, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to relocate a machine to System V Init without reinstallation and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you will need a script for every system service that you want to start up to another runlevel. system services include such things like Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are based on rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default running level 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script ends with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could have a user-runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between running leveln or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or position)."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you move them to a new level. to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present there is no way to restore items thrown into the Recycle Bin. so, be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorter number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
