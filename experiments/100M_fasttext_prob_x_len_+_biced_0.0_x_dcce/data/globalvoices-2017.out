&quot; although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced American music , read American authors and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his view he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in multi@@ tudes for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican presidential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the nomin@@ ee of the Party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that people from all over the world record , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; even though Tr@@ um@@ ps did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ tolerance stands also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced by Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gled for the environment for life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits with the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew le@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ x Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot during my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down upon those who look differently from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ) : as much as &quot; &quot; Char@@ ming the Wh@@ ites Against All Other Eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; word@@ play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the great Van Jones , has killed exactly that which America made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the White Americas this promise and says : &quot; hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; rum@@ oured the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were loud . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and it breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close link with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; once they come out of the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments , made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion all made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the early times : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from re@@ processed material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of gar@@ bage every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est , as the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , it became known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly upset , and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ense to this species on its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to lodge one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y agency , rec@@ alls . he is part of a team who discovered and persec@@ uted the ship in time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to the pill@@ age of the fish stocks in the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who then exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; this means that we have eight countries , who are like minded and work together . they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing have been hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are done in real @-@ time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , so suspic@@ ious driving routes can be discovered - such as suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal case . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform has been created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries .
&quot; their practices include actions like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of imag@@ inations , fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You &apos;re not going to run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
&quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious vessels . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tr@@ acked and found volati@@ le ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly developed , also helps to trace the illegal craft that are gladly hiding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , a NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be hosted by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that combines different levels of information , and it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal acting ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana marine protection organisation , Sky@@ truth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally by means of the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing - that &apos;s simply sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust@@ s has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel criminals , but also fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; ships formerly used without a license and hardly had consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile posted a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board Schle@@ pp@@ nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal of even more such initiatives and structures will also be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to announce his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship travelling under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also steep@@ ed in forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a particular , collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

&quot; after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s application for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by joining the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations can be found and arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - including Bar@@ inas , in the Méri@@ da region and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country is continually wor@@ sen@@ ing what is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president , Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the rel@@ uc@@ tance of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is , the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round Table of Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , the demonstr@@ ators gathered for the majority of representatives from the opposition after the 2015 elections and a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , on November 3 . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also con@@ front@@ ations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of suppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear a skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something , which many national gar@@ den@@ ists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already accounts for the degree of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the claim for a period of office - it has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado prove that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your re@@ birth !
on the road !
&quot; others values these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , made little effort against the devastating economic crisis and would rather be busy to c@@ um critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or buy . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , Qui@@ j@@ ano said to his father , Qui@@ j@@ ano in the course of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept secret for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t realize that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tort@@ ur@@ man and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Service Division 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who before a federal court pronounced against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power one parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made yourself friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass on , that they don &apos;t kidn@@ ap you one day and I will save you . &quot;
&quot; the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become secret . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
&quot; all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There are the prisoners tort@@ ured ?
&quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot;
&quot; at the first and last time , he left me in the car at the entrance . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I se@@ wed inside and saw a couch that people were tort@@ ured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later on , I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the person &apos;s body , which was tied up there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I know that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eye @-@ tie . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked humans lay down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people sat quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I met &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero defeated there a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to survivors of the survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of having participated in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , killed the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here , is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tort@@ ured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from the top came that they were to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ be@@ amed &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as it was named - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military badge , which was fought against an enemy that was fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not war @-@ spo@@ ils , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : &quot; &quot; and you , who steal cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and move you in your own hands . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do this !
this was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a conspir@@ ator with this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find repentance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you can see the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you have executed people in the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but why did the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with him home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself again and again : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why should their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom they could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were comfor@@ ted and disp@@ osed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , anything remains always . &quot;
I have seen how you killed people !
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
&quot; I made him alleg@@ ations about all the atro@@ cities , which I had to witness . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt internally upset and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; Well , then I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
2010 ref@@ unded the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally declared against my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 , under house arrest , pending before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : under severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 98 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of age . &quot;

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in the Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended in August of between March 1975 and December 1978 , crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for justice for the victims for years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government delivered the country where La Per@@ la was located , so that there was a memorial to be erected there , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the shield with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license last month witnesses a very particularly mis@@ used translation . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; old motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; means , wron@@ g@@ ly - perhaps also with vi@@ cious rear @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1st to 20th .
&quot; editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was made to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a local Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily paper Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n published in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , though gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an impro@@ per description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but cause concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,9@@ 41 was caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents by sen@@ iors , which corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the rep@@ orter , named un@@ named rep@@ orter , presented comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show which pre@@ judi@@ ces are some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo about the translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; If the translation is flaw@@ ed , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for translation , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the original language - be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; a French native speaker , for example , should translate English into French - not French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could be translated into English . this may result in a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who themselves do not have foreign employees , can still manufacture translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese staff , whose English skills are considered to be the best , are made available to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and mysterious pro@@ positions , which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the City of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the Portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which opposed the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was short@@ ened and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Vene@@ tians with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ tant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with money pun@@ ishments and closures , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
&quot; amazing , that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro certi@@ fies that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains er@@ ron@@ eous . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ sponsored channel , was transferred on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transmitted the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina fights for the rights of children , collecting testim@@ onies of other cri@@ tiques that have been just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened version of a review by the cur@@ ator , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( Flying C@@ ows , Temp@@ ting Schools ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she did not eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their min@@ der@@ less son or their min@@ der@@ less daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must do so inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testim@@ onies and den@@ ounced and den@@ ounced .
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against the Cri@@ adi@@ tes guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they conclude their training , can improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with herself and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in hiding in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant in the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered serious injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ min@@ tas are not only exploited by workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , along with him and to read editorial papers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to have no faith in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stop her . &quot; the owner had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . so they thought , that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose their education , which they had made possible , declared them . &quot;
&quot; she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;

&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job ads for cleaning personnel and children in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administrators are P@@ epa Cos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
&quot; Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot;
for learning .
please inform yourselves .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the interior that would like to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the author of the ad switched itself once again :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report of Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long is ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , had to pay tribute to their &quot; wives . &quot; &quot;
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the public domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered at a government authority to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ves and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration . un@@ clear is also how they should make up those who do not register themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and sponsors of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password by the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation Department to block Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to educ@@ ate a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
&quot; but until now , it is not known that such plans exist . &quot;
experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could be done online too . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , this means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who claim a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them to a court decision . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his assumption and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y parliamentary dep@@ u@@ ties proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those intended to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest in protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq &apos;s war
one of the rare Persian le@@ op@@ ards .

&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the shelter H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact in the free game is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera field , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is keen to passion@@ ately reveal another aspect of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to setting up protective zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and filmm@@ aker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o daily , which was responsible for the northeast of Japan , has been making progress in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami , and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a real pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had both to experience the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami that emerged . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate have been ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared entire coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture under@@ went a nuclear accident , already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from the local point of view , the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been reached six years later to re@@ build the lives of local residents . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed ( later , they were completed , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , even six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by authorities ( the &quot; &quot; War &quot; , &quot; Kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) res@@ ett@@ les into final spare houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , more and more people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , have opened its doors until December 2016 , which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now operational , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma has resum@@ ed only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have largely been affected . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed cultivated land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , however , can show only 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe , almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants have felt it more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to find an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys conducted among the local people and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . &quot;
in its introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken action to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung has also focused on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ causing , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led to permanent homes . &quot;
&quot; after the stand of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who are still in homes , are older than 50 years old . they will have to compete in proper hab@@ itation , because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it appears at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ looks the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a popular photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 received this week in the intensive care unit . last Friday a police officer had attacked him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana with a stroke against the head .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him on this Saturday and have put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stock@@ pile . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active service to the conclusion of the incident . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officer , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a prot@@ esters and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Dis@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are rus@@ hing towards him shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also reflected in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ avan while he is in the hospital . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence . here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he was supported by the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary Schools . here , we have had the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick . &quot;
police gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brut@@ ality against prot@@ esters last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , urged the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media turned out street protests by turning the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a story story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause . &quot;
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets a absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on con@@ front@@ ational discourse with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization of Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories across Cuba included the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar harvesting on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who runs every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region sugar cane factories exist , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not new . &quot;
why was the cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church had seen better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons . &quot;
&quot; they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of construction , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the still@@ ed factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still put into operation &quot; , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the stopp@@ age of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important workplace producer has been extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to work places and services that were generated in the commun@@ es in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the People &apos;s Con@@ gregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to stop them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were divided into spare parts .
&quot; without a view of the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ forty harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;

first Nations you@@ ths use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they do them with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop leaders have brought mobile key studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ perception &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called Highway of tears , a street section in West Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although teenagers do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the ref@@ rain will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the youth involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day when you will take our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way of life as a youth
but I believe that we will lift one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; in this way , they can grow and increase our youth as well . &quot;
this is how they can do what they intended for the creator .
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ents of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic items are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plasma models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of every food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders has documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic items are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend has turned them into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic rub@@ bers decorated mobile phone bands as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in eating habits is increasingly complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon che@@ eses are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
some users had doubts on Twitter :
&quot; there is somebody who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon che@@ ating ? . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic rub@@ bers can also adopt a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting snow .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes , you can view yourself at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # ib@@ m@@ x , ge@@ om@@ o@@ int . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of national and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ gi@@ sts and killed regularly appear only in stat@@ s . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this battle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with the drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the battle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and need to drive whole communities for so many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret gra@@ ves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and look for gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
&quot; Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they do not pay them out , because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of journalists and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been acquainted with disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I am coming by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day , and I see the title pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or by specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different at this time or consider it normal .
she continues :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they are sin@@ king those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are to blo@@ t numbers in a statistics .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; inc@@ ess@@ ant . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : as a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; &quot; it describes how an armed criminal month took money from their business until they destroyed not only the business , but also torn their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain over it never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these horrible days whether crying would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potatoes , make tor@@ tillas warm and make &quot; &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a force through organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ution counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to 8.5 hours per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few hundred thousands of stories , which leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country . &quot;
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand innocent words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which he links , include images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something happened for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to make trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the East of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that . &quot;
&quot; authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people who watched the football world championship . &quot;
houses br@@ anded and co@@ ded cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recognis@@ ability .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of fo@@ al bodies lying on the ground while individuals look at them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and mistakenly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up period could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win a country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , when it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely relate the image from DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following written these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian intelligence page that fal@@ sely claimed , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to make this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , known as AF@@ P as their source , also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but did not bring the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false species reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually from all over the world .
&quot; with an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures of 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the scann@@ ed image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing mask of private pages , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded incorrect reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have limited examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what site they have been published . by doing so , we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below , some examples may be used for ab@@ usive use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be split completely ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , the Catholic near@@ ing news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ yl@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is sleeping ) . &quot;
&quot; the DR Congo picture appeared with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was swe@@ pt as evidence for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ pt ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not interfer@@ ed with in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be wrong . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clara Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sides in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) also points to Tin@@ Eye but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original disaster of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ valued in comparison with European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent imag@@ ery has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding pictures of a refusal equ@@ als to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent pictures and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study that investig@@ ates how violent media works to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be derived from the context or completely ab@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; however , every examination of false ten@@ ders should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses the CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog called &quot; &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; &quot; ( e.g. inv@@ inci@@ ble ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these uns@@ ett@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ ink language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ an your parents in recognition of how to make your efforts in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they ent@@ ail other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ lic@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is surrounded by the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have come across the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people were missed due to the floo@@ ds and mud pools . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; rain falls on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water conditions in some areas slowly reg@@ ained . &quot;
health and hygiene practices of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water st@@ alls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to flood control .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ erk@@ rise , warns Save the Children , after further rains are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in flood water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water peg@@ s of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are transported to the transport of emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
various organizations and startups have also been willing to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood control and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all who want to don@@ ate dry foods and essential goods for flood victims , &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
&quot; please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this field . &quot;
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum .
&quot; last year following the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood help &quot; button that allowed users to retrieve a vehicle for retri@@ eving assistance and donations . &quot;
&quot; they also launched an &quot; SO@@ S &quot; key , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March will be held in San Francisco on 21 January 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her for my four years old daughter , she trust@@ s me her children . she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the last minute we call for par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next , we seek rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some consider the iconic image of a woman with head scarf , bound from an American flag , others gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they kidn@@ ap me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , as I do not pur@@ pos@@ ely fit there , are ab@@ domin@@ ating . &quot;
to be ab@@ ov@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of him when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sm@@ ashed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to do . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that during the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has taken our collective imagination into so deeply and flaw@@ ed that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and chic@@ an@@ ations .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to seize the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ stock@@ ed Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scrap@@ ers ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; at that time , when Khan had re@@ invented the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were overwhel@@ med by Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now In@@ vol@@ ved Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of picking up my Muslim recipes or hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ ap , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological expert to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional safety checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already flaw@@ ed image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger who swe@@ eps the head of a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
my Muslim faith and behaviour are perhaps not always visible but they are there .
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf will see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I was silent in my arms and aff@@ or@@ ded her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
my Muslim faith may not always be visible but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

&quot; belonging to me is the image of my grandmother , mother@@ ly with her sisters , how to win a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi several decades ago . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Mus@@ lim@@ a is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over centuries - has been colon@@ ized by an empire , which has established a company named Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God the only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men are not crying , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt over his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first pilot bomb of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ an under@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there was air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means that fourteen years ago the m@@ igh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent aside from Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy eng@@ ages the US and carries the suspect a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four @-@ hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this land . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent ambig@@ u@@ ity of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ ten@@ ders , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube of magic , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and to establish all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this branch create structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened with President Obama . &quot;
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; , &quot; which largely decreases Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we carry , and the bombs that we reject to Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
we are too deep to dism@@ iss the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we are coming back for decades , recogni@@ zing the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous print@@ outs we have in our news@@ letters . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ War Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; S@@ ay &apos;s Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was so old , as it was my daughter now , but who made me an un@@ disp@@ uted Muslim today . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story may be l@@ ur@@ king where someone is made to one &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations took place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

&quot; we all need to ask ourselves , why ? &quot;
&quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were included in the public presentation , four decades ago , was the scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I have done in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he has already broken broken countries and &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
narrative Art Initiative wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; during &quot; listening &quot; often connected with it , &quot; &quot; purposes of these events &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; listening to feel &quot; &quot; to feel , to touch . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and depic@@ tion lead to the fact that the audience lets itself on it . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
you were with me !
&quot; so far , the events organised by Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own history narrative tours . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ determination of state debt by the United States
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in mass demonstration last April , 2017 ; the march started in the Dominican Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran down to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
she was called out by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Bürger@@ front for the ne@@ ural testing of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , banks and government officials are responsible for debt to be accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand financial scrut@@ iny and a management committee without personal interests at public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which is in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; extern@@ ally imposed measures , without the participation and conviction of the citizens , are at risk to be rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration took the name &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture which is organised in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign was devoted . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot;
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge , and what are the real costs associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by individuals on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his residence and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps , none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes were more forward than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began to work with this work , the IS would do everything about this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ria , but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my whole life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually being in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath , which she wrote to her husband between 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ ged the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book Cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the misery of the prison
and I enter into every detail your voice and words
&quot; which I wear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I am convinced myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el :
&quot; a year goes , my soul &quot;
during the day
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared from the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tort@@ ured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release again on previous post
&quot; Muslims responded with anger to a corruption incident , where a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his sentence , where corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately requested his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which adverti@@ sed the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary action after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Center for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , abbrevi@@ ated C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle . &quot;
&quot; it is a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary case against the wron@@ g@@ doing .
&quot; however , the company apparently was silent and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case to be &quot; disgu@@ sting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of which had been cut off . &quot;
&quot; he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ lu@@ te his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly !
&quot; bit@@ one vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil said , the director does not say any morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks morality to return to the state and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served solely by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , who will not only remain in memory to the Mozambique cans , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was when he confirmed energetic that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the Fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious human is changing , my experience shows that it &apos;s not that way . he does not change tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being at the same time criminal . &quot;
in t@@ witter the reactions were also negative :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , in which he ren@@ ders mon@@ ies , res@@ ides under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ ι@@ κ@@ FESTIVAL ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely valuable con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written in Bur@@ mes@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ endor@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook had to be more analy@@ tic before reading any posts that were suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading the hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards &quot; &quot; failed . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook before the start of the initiative should have done more , for example , asking the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ orship such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have been banned as words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ri@@ dic@@ ule among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now thinking about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which did not include hate speech but were still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; post says &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where struggles between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure , the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its bur@@ m@@ ese sites . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on context rather than code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to prohi@@ bit this practice so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now at the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the spouse , some members held Hindu@@ istic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public cry . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere as that , age is not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were anxious to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; however , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this rather un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - in spite of 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and none of them decided against it . &quot;
&quot; once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Facebook Member Lov@@ ell Francis , who cloth@@ ed a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has conce@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson believed that it took a long time to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was at last : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot; &quot; excellent news ! &quot;
the sp@@ ouses have been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment to the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote . &quot;
all MEPs who were opposed have voted for the law .
&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , children are no longer allowed . &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ ra@@ dab@@ s .

a Thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announces his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to release his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed against the law , most social media users wished that the debate would be different to the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; rather than talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem that we would invite the state to invite our bedrooms , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ led men who are facing them in the benefit , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s needs are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws which they say . &quot;

thanks for sharing ! Od@@ go@@ vor@@ i
&quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosec@@ utor announced the local news service Yar@@ on , that they were chopped . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the mirrors of web pages , Turkish users can once again watch Wikipedia content &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since more than a month , Turkey is blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day becomes more clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information , as well as reliable information . &quot;
both students and rep@@ or@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many techniques @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use change tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users are not in this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey was blocking articles by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several mirror pages ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform provided all the Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the content is available in spite of legal ban . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all of it to place snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed ways . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mir@@ ror@@ sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
you access another URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server runs the request to the correct wi@@ ki@@ pedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
&quot; a so@@ othing r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and well @-@ balanced colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera in himself and try to gr@@ ind the situation .
&quot; at that time , he was still a child . &quot;
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animal world onto the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I just stopped at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he was already standing by the face of the faces of the face toward face : &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ ick appeared . he sat down right away , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ ney and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should desp@@ ise the norm to preserve this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a false court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and ch@@ ased by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not mention the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less as@@ per@@ ation to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff and house@@ wives , came up with a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the Campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the mining of patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in its panel discussion , was women who did not name their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
&quot; not saying the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they owe all the duty and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not respect this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent until the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked everybody , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women must never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she gig@@ gled in front of herself during the whole exercise , and another decided to release all the an@@ gled fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received numerous reports . &quot;
&quot; the husband of a woman called out Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put on her head : his wife could not stop telling his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ graphic point on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ d point if he did it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with every club . &quot;
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never talked so honest about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ted cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice , morality linked with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ ged their own couple of cur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it . &quot;
Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come to roll in the five months since their first discussion has changed .
&quot; so far , we have only taken small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then again listened to the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and not other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
&quot; the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives , such as the gri@@ pping for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini says :
each one of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag ( Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is considered a revers@@ al of the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! : today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . by 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les &apos;s memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Winn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit : &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les &apos;s memorial day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On were on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community in a market @-@ specific manner , like this R@@ amen shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! : today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?
I will listen to &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day will be running today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;
&quot; this is followed by the h@@ ash@@ tag : &quot; &quot; sacred Bridge &quot; , &quot; to learn more about the Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;
cat @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that men @-@ headed men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of single @-@ headed people for organ trading , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
&quot; there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could discover gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to a mission conducted by the UN in 2016 in the South African country , to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Mozambique police warned after the latest assass@@ inations of three single @-@ headed men because of their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of single @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the Chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a on Facebook , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty , facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I would like to use ONE MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH sh@@ amed a country in which the people would have shame to go on the road , to demand sex against good grades , and do not take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald heads for super@@ sti@@ tion purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim to get rich wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not escape the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter @-@ user , twe@@ ets that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ han , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both single @-@ headed : &quot;
mos@@ a@@ ics authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of faith @-@ headed people .

we are deeply concerned by experiencing the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deepest sympathy towards his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) is a key role in expanding public access to Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meetings with Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were spending themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their man was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ que &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we show the honour of creating Bass@@ el as a pioneer of open web movement . &quot;
we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the past five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , so the organisation Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime or for@@ ci@@ bly disappeared , torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in custody , thus the International Human Rights Organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that promp@@ ted democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man that he considers it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should put pressure in order to enable Li@@ u abroad to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway - Belgium
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway got st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government informed that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony he was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she said in an explanation on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; us Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad said that &quot; &quot; Americans &quot; &quot; would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he assi@@ sts him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , according to Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I demand China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit.ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany - Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns , whether the vort@@ ex for Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um invited China to provide appropriate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always over@@ sees the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release these rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France ( EN )
&quot; on 29 June , France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there was no further information whether France would eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan in Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u , and to show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the ill intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for his well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly because Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark prov@@ oked a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; turn the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a duty of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of this , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er appears again from the author@@ itarian makers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ replies . &quot;
he warned these questions in a rational way with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ gam to illustrate his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clear this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; as An@@ on published his commentary on the blog , he points out regarding the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; Be not a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least , I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ham &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian pro@@ pon@@ ent ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the Cabinet of Government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies , such as &quot; &quot; the defence of the country , above all &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ? &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication often follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in fear of anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack , when they travel . &quot;
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was , when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are cour@@ te@@ ous .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot;
Canada is report@@ edly considered the most toler@@ ant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter if you would be confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be fun - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really were a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
&quot; that can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &apos; nice &apos; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence along with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau put the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ ody , which in 2014 took power and despite its promise to restore the civil government , the country still reig@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) , the Band tat@@ too , describes a young man who tells the rules about his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 lights . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ kon@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest milit@@ ants and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted persons who accused the monarchy to have been prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Defense ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now been over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ b@@ astic war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ und@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called the gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after having hardly climbed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are lap@@ id@@ ated and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why do I talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that all served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ry@@ ch@@ ov@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where linen is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as mentioned in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter , and she insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead . &quot;
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; she calls T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A her . &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia broke just away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it tells us that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but in the course of time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation ends , a little boy runs over us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then rolls down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for the un@@ certain@@ ties in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it any other way .

&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ th @-@ year @-@ old Mexican girl , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bears . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many of them under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also slept outside on boxes . &quot;
she does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they bu@@ ys them medicines that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his trip to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he has sold SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he replies , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told her guests often send text messages when they went to greet her , or to tell her about the course of her trip . &quot;
it declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have taught them to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is very well known here , but she is not the only spar@@ ks hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar a night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchenette outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to press money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him the roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses the traveler quietly consul@@ ted their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she pu@@ dd@@ les in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens she has made an art girl , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she puts it in front of me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , can be used in the Valley of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10th , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi got a mobile phone notification in which it indicates the District Government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web purification &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would establish and follow the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to inform users how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , afflic@@ ted ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet on Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from Al China , &quot; published by cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers were random@@ ly checking whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity thanks to the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( T@@ EST ) released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and therefore receives un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the Party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; an up @-@ to @-@ date report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible tre@@ aties , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you are looking at and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has dissolved gradually and revealed a truth , which is clearly visible , both from the inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes all honour to their name .
one that has sm@@ ashed down into a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality is re@@ covering and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is moving on the axis of evil . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to rent the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; cri@@ es .
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods desired , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I have no high demands on a city that has been added to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a glorious picture that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you realize that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low up - nothing can give you your voice back , after giving it all the way to the office of security service . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you are called &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his face @-@ filled eyes were on me .
and you are sad to see me in your eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest night entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father straight away . &quot;
&quot; his father , with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I en@@ rolled the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me . &quot;
then back through the farm and into the second office that leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I &apos;ll give you all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they have assigned me a larger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and may put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the bureaucr@@ at left the cell , and I rever@@ ted to an old tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : to beat the wall with the fist . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was an &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ afen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me finally . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive faces can be seen in me , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him , if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ori@@ ously lab@@ eled on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus , the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent that we release the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their denom@@ in@@ ational ex@@ tor@@ tion card and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a land here ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail@@ ure him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join you and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I didn &apos;t have done anything to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably origin@@ ates from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er spar@@ ed at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector earlier or if that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cab@@ el . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t find anything at all , why he grab@@ bed an electri@@ cally charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ sting youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father needs to worry aw@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; at times he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what you can rely on , a cigarette can be discovered between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who is opposing the conservative majority and questioned their old tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he swe@@ eps a special rel@@ uc@@ tance to U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , do anything with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian &quot; wing@@ ed of the second generation , &quot; he said , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b stresses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think that because I am a human being , &quot; while in water , Nes@@ café is poured into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the mud @-@ warm coffee and the sw@@ aths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and the main reason for the concert tale . &quot;
&quot; the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic Coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b , said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many pre@@ tend that the engagement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might not be easy to be rhetor@@ ic , but actually reflect an ever @-@ clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s traditional sex men moved to Lei@@ be by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex before . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust . &quot;
&quot; in Jordan , the number of &apos; honour kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan is still app@@ alling that Jordan has failed to support institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for the crime of crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence must be held in prison for in@@ definite time , and for their release there is often a long @-@ standing bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to do . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he adm@@ its that he is unable to separate his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics in@@ tru@@ ded me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - whether it be faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is campaig@@ ning for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ da , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who was later to work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service arrested several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , with the reason they would have cri@@ tically expressed the problems in social media comments related to the deep corruption rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s concert is just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; her . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , stre@@ at@@ uni@@ tions and art @-@ led democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to coat and therefore also resist . &quot;
&quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man was a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , the drums and dancing have been sur@@ passed over a thousand years , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ hi , to its knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two st@@ rollers are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high dur@@ a was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; out@@ ward appearances and body care were as important as in this story , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate job like the bar@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean close to the historic center of the capital of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the School of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in the hair style instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities to offer , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year started in March and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , as we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with kind permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accommodate aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this is precisely why the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation did not come out of the head and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ciliation ) who encouraged young people to write err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa war F@@ ARC ( German : Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the cl@@ ue of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos won the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bian people , however , there is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ ev , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhetor@@ ic , and around the clock carrying their weapons , must now be re @-@ integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , adapted to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans join together and help the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , to welcome them back in society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who will then be delivered personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he was planning to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC got up as they had done before to accept the instructions of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ riors live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed an M@@ GL shell was lying , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I asked him anyway and said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life somebody has written something so nice , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran into tears of the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ nets .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice by the State on the whole of Colom@@ bian people has eman@@ ated . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country fair@@ er . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster and even hate me , are only people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people willing to take up arms to stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ ova and whose original publication took place on the OC Media website .
&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which hangs just like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ hi@@ ft above the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , did not come into existence only overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published that ag@@ grav@@ ated the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear for her life , she moved into the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos from my documents took the lap through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you return the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up the last end of the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had got everything along and started crying . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called up an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which nursing homes , you were laid - in the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it , but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked me absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family manage to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only humili@@ ated your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother got too much and she put a rope around her neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment , and a few hours later , a car was placed under the window with a window of windows and a number plate with a number of 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was a little la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to reveal their names for safety reasons , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering me , without notice , without notice . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you would be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
just to prove you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
&quot; some traditionally Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an items , I still carry in myself . &quot;
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with a camera , I really try to look like the person looking out from her past - i.e. my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have been d@@ ord@@ ant ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who has settled in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
&quot; he told that no people were arrested and tort@@ ured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; with this , I mean , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : an acquain@@ tance of me says there were not so many .
&quot; if , then most of all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to ask Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are captured there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show off their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but pur@@ pos@@ ely di@@ pped to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
&quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard has grown . &quot;
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was themselves when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think that before 2003 I was already known in quite Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes and wore Sk@@ inn@@ y jeans and short Tops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never hurt me only one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they often say to children , when they make fun of the sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they closed their eyes to you , because they believed they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period hold ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us by se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , watched you at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for this .
I discovered these people themselves when I cl@@ apped the places of refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth that there are no g@@ ays with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines , who , the Russians , have whatever ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s uncomfortable to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - prac@@ tising Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think in terms of transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of self @-@ kill@@ ings within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to pay for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video , shared on YouTube , held the moments when he had lit up himself . &quot;
&quot; some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ am hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family pat@@ ters who were hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of pursuing their families and to pursue a safe job . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which most of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; before a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over power , and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy all over Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets very little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of tribes , the waters of Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have university degrees . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and be employed , since even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm goes before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - are acting with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
the fact that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to skin color , on racism , on black women &apos;s women , black women in the LGB@@ TI community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used under racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used by racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have to be silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; raise their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; to sing , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ating violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
&quot; or , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with migration background are more often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color equal rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join myself as a black woman in whose centre the white woman stands who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in their thinking , referring to both gender and skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a simple and margin@@ alized entity in an historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to in@@ struct them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and differenti@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely and completely from femin@@ ism and to connect me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( such as : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by focusing on our own way . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alisation after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a repeatedly travelled over the past 7 years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water channels in Iraq as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we no longer had water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , little appreci@@ able sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed churches can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence

the article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ turally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # christ@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out because of ill @-@ treatment , the ac@@ ten@@ tious display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also used nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back her display . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not even refund , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , report themselves at all by law enforcement agencies . &quot;
&quot; § 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system , which is not inhibit@@ ing 3 Paragu@@ ays law : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various indications and reports , which , however , do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Prosec@@ utor filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads reported by the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . here too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements 40 % of women said they were physically ill @-@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; to any woman that is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder is not a crime in Paraguay , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists recorded at least 12 cases of murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she said . this should always rep@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable : &quot;
I never thought I would ever be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ missive because they can be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had insul@@ ted her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rhetor@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other fac@@ ebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had such a long time of Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner handled them . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; finally , her wealthy partner was able to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result , and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ newcom@@ ers ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain and pun@@ ish Fem@@ izi@@ d for an independent existence and to pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ ly , as is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus , the Code of Law has been modified in some respects to also win the MPs for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is denied , which are fundamentally prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ aw the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which must be borne by the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to refund only ad and maintain a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will get away . &quot;
we have to refund so long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed on in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases called domestic violence for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; however , the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban on a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had depos@@ ed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the single Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ ans &apos; rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic secret services , public freedoms , including freedom of press , to restrict and incar@@ cer@@ ate human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , and other activists . &quot;
&quot; authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the title page titled : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was charged from the ISS before the special department and arrested upon arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS pursued the Deputy Chief @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed for an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Information issued the order that &quot; publication and distribution of the paper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the newspaper &apos;s final closure .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3,000 US $ ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ val ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his sentence . &quot;
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the minister once again presented himself against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ain@@ ment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities to : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their ri@@ ghtful human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial chic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization , human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to gather , support and protect themselves . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustrated with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for medical research on site , there are two reasons : for one thing missing in the offer of global healthcare many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria are far more severe in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on applying research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just star@@ ed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being a maker himself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; lab equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which are facing challenges . &quot;
the system that periodic@@ als make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how open source seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported about solutions for environmental issues around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ rage , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get . &quot;
&quot; but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or card varieties . because of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate expon@@ ent of a m@@ illen@@ nia of old tradition Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but he now needs longer because his work gets more and more difficult due to more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river it is a b@@ oul@@ der lying around which I must triumph .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new kind of salad because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and does not endeav@@ or to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement which is growing in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source ) is inspired by the free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders are able to commit to free use of seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders do only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many pesti@@ cides . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seeds , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants may be patented , whether vegetable , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; says he and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed as the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights available on plant material , which is therefore always available , un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted attributes - from such , by which their taste or colour improves until such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever , as the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ tible due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; it contra@@ di@@ cts the notion that intellectual property conf@@ ers other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but fo@@ sters it by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees this differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ els , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on , however , is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; on the whole , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation , are required to grow mass@@ y her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they manage to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they refuse the pat@@ enting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant @-@ bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that bree@@ der through the avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ ent@@ ations would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which one makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which ultimately marks a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding are different from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot be simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now on the Member States Govern@@ ments to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official launch . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group to erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I , hopes that soon more people will be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government opened the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about it . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains bt@@ w - despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , it has never been as important as it is now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages , e.g. the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language version of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network based on alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web@@ cast closures fell victim to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of articles and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , which is native to the also Zi@@ adas blog , is still accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , as police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself about the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to lock blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; A arrest , a temp@@ ted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , though only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities locked up from May 24 to August 06 , 133 . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; moreover , af@@ te documented the blocking of vendors , through the envel@@ oping of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ PN@@ s were offering began . &quot;
&quot; such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block content and filter , which Egyptian users could have access . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the situation is wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions behind closed doors are made , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against these acts of action . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day for day newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; For the second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; V@@ ine rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers in the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a stra@@ ined financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; the paper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; That is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything , but what happens to the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; the same video explains a journalist from the newspaper , that according to the Institute of In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes further : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; say more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ing against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ acent neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ ale rates per federal state , Rio is on No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; it is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police station and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not match the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to employ means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ clear point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; mistaken glob@@ es &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war on or off , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
one week it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ char@@ tist died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the United Nations and other human rights organisations have committed the massacre of Assad &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those areas controlled by rebels have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , causing inhabitants to rely on locally manufactured or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tion of the Project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project more known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more awareness . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally manufactured fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; &quot; production from the regions of mushroom seeds &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; frac@@ ture of si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) to generate new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot;
&quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas , and we can help humanity . &quot;

&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many districts of Portugal , and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured in the wake of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the last week , the government proclaimed a state of state of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
&quot; fires were also recorded in the region of Gal@@ icia , Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 qu@@ arri@@ es , spread in the northern and central areas of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy took place in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
&quot; so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot;

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire prevention measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Federation of farmers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; Lei@@ ria &apos;s forest would have had a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in places with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the wh@@ ale form , which the government introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , are still spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; these problems are added to the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers had not stopped the 40@@ 0.000 users who followed the fires , while the site counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t tell it at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Hez@@ bollah , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many of Haz@@ ara were suddenly fu@@ tile . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found herself in Pakistan again . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal mine . work was difficult and made him ill . &quot;
&quot; once again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars who were he@@ avier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in a standing building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t refres@@ h at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without documents in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing over the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for the past asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high levels of protection . however , it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the civil rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ bo@@ unded li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having worked several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some Afgh@@ ans have sprung up , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul factory in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; thus they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : bill dra@@ fts out of Egypt allow the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for over 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snap@@ shot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users would have to register within six months following the legislative decree on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identification number . &quot;
those who miss this step might be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the de@@ ple@@ tion of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently under legislative and the constitu@@ tive Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the Parliament filed a proposal to introduce the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the accus@@ ation of the President or a senior official . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such a deed would be punished with prison and money pun@@ ishments , as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the sentenced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years anyway . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he held violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup committed against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to May 20 , because the prison administration in accordance with human rights groups failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , false exposure , among other things , weapons of possession , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ bl@@ at@@ ting murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iza was speaking the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ischer activists listen to scann@@ ed documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been largely inter@@ rog@@ ated to a continuous action plan . said Plan comes from the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan expressly supports a controversial bill of legislation , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials of am@@ nesty , provided they return all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document released on 21 April on Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , sheds light on how the presidential schemes look like to support the legislative process . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the nam@@ ing of his sources stating articles 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which gave journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on the 9th of May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations by the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that registration with full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts assume that hereby the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these provisions only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat refused to register as a &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a stat@@ ute from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that will organize the publication of information . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
tur@@ k@@ ish dish has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; Turkish court decre@@ ed the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the declarations , Turkey support the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications agreed that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; a source of information that co @-@ operates with groups to address a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey fully blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain does not stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance applications , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor @-@ Programs which de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications enterprises and intelligence services related to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil society outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
