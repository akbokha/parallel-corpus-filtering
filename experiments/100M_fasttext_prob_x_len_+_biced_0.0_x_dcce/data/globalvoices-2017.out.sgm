<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced American music, read American authors and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his view he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in multitudes for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number ever reached by the nominee of the Party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that people from all over the world record, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"even though Trumps did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance stands also in contrast to the generosity I experienced by Sandy Bahr, who struggled for the environment for life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew lekey, Kathryn McManus and Rex Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot during my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down upon those who look differently from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(" "Whitelash" "): as much as" "Charming the Whites Against All Other Ethnicities" "; wordplay from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as it called the great Van Jones, has killed exactly that which America made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the White Americas this promise and says:" hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "rumoured the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were loud. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close link with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, the La banda de m√∫sica (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come out of the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest landfill site of Asunci√≥n in Paraguays capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments, made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Ch√°vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early times:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra playing instruments from reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest, as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, it became known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were correspondingly upset, and little inclined to welcome a criminal offense to this species on its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to lodge one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishery agency, recalls. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship in time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to the pillage of the fish stocks in the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who then expelled the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" this means that we have eight countries, who are like minded and work together. they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, why it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing have been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are done in real-time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, by means of satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, so suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as suggesting that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal case."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform has been created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of imaginations, fish-protected species and fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "says Long." "formerly a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You're not going to run my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front is working."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly developed, also helps to trace the illegal craft that are gladly hiding."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which also deals with fishery data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be hosted by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland therefore helps to build a system that combines different levels of information, and it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal acting ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO Skytruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, with Google and the Oceana marine protection organisation, Skytruth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who's doing - that's simply sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships formerly used without a license and hardly had consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile posted a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found on board Schleppnets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the goal of even more such initiatives and structures will also be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to announce his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship travelling under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also steeped in forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a particular, collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president, Nicol√°s Maduro, but in the end the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne D√≠az, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine is, the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed inside and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">"later on, I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the person's body, which was tied up there."</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driver's license last month witnesses a very particularly misused translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the Japanese word" "old motorists" "means, wrongly - perhaps also with vicious rear-thought & # 8212; as" "fearful motorists". ""</seg>

<seg id="351">"the mistake was made to the translator Julian Holmes, a local Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily paper Kyoto Shimbun published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was initially removed. the term" "terrible drivers" "(German:" terrible drivers ") was later replaced by the appropriate, though grammatically not quite correct designation" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto Police apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt insulted by the insufficient correction (the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News took a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "fearful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" terrible "has been denounced as an improper description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents, but cause concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 was caused by a total of 19,460 accidents by seniors, which corresponds to a 10% share."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, Seniors 1,803 caused a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, their share increased to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translation, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"a French native speaker, for example, should translate English into French - not French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could be translated into English. this may result in a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who themselves do not have foreign employees, can still manufacture translations in-house. then the Japanese staff, whose English skills are considered to be the best, are made available to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and mysterious propositions, which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace any human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. however, by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the City of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their minderless son or their minderless daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children must do so innumerable days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collecting testimonies and denounced and denounced.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunci√≥n.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had."</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay image, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the public domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently agreed to draft legislation on "the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by the Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must be registered at a government authority to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up in order to give citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraves and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application, which runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video alignment and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make up the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and sponsors of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password by the Telecommunication Department to block Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to educate a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">"but until now, it is not known that such plans exist."</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could be done online too."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, this means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who claim a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them to a court decision."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his assumption and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and ensured that no different narration is present on the picture surface, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="524">"this post by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq, the shelter Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"like Raza in the video shows," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in fact in the free game is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera field, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza is keen to passionately reveal another aspect of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">"since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to setting up protective zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo daily, which was responsible for the northeast of Japan, has been making progress in the last six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami, and an atom accident in Fukushima triggered the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a real prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had both to experience the earthquake and the tsunami that emerged."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated, because the tsunami had disappeared entire coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima Prefecture underwent a nuclear accident, already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from the local point of view, the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been reached six years later to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed (later, they were completed, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, even six years after the disaster, evacuated by authorities (the" "War", "Kasetsu juutaku) resettles into final spare houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, more and more people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, have opened its doors until December 2016, which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now operational, Fukushima has resumed only 30 percent of the fishing harbours."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have largely been affected."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed cultivated land of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear wave zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far removed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same level, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, however, can show only 75 percent here."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe, almost half of the coast-inhabitants have felt it more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to find an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys conducted among the local people and among the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken action to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung has also focused on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, disaster-causing, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled to permanent homes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the stand of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuees, who are still in homes, are older than 50 years old. they will have to compete in proper habitation, because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons."</seg>

<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. they do them with hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, workshop leaders have brought mobile key studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstar."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in talks like" cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-perception "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called Highway of tears, a street section in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although teenagers do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain will be sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the youth involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>

<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way of life as a youth</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plasma models of the dishes" ") of every food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders has documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic items are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend has turned them into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic rubbers decorated mobile phone bands as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in eating habits is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura and salmon cheeses are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">Some users had doubts on Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is somebody who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon cheating?. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic rubbers can also adopt a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting snow.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"for more skurrile plastic dishes, you can view yourself at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter to the hashtag # ibmx, geomoint."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of national and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the misgists and killed regularly appear only in stats. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this battle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzm√°n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with the drug trafficking "), which is to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the battle between the prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Pol√≠tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and need to drive whole communities for so many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who is looking for secret graves after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodr√≠guez, who lost their father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and look for graves, according to the people we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">"Guadalupe Contreras:" "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata."</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but they do not pay them out, because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of journalists and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Pol√≠tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I am coming by newspaper kiosks every day, and I see the title pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or by specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent at this time or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroic" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they are sinking those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are to blot numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were" incessant. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to persuade them to remain spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" "Four months blackmail in the main city district: as a family with threats has been plundered." "it describes how an armed criminal month took money from their business until they destroyed not only the business, but also torn their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">"you think of everything you have lost, and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days."</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain over it never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these horrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten children of Ciudad Ju√°rez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potatoes, make tortillas warm and make" "chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the vial with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Ju√°rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as a force through organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ju√°rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecution counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to 8.5 hours per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just a few hundred thousands of stories, which leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country."</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Pol√≠tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the East of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tanker fell victim to that."</seg>

<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and mistakenly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>

<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "said a resident of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were crushed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up period could be illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win a country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>

<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments like this example falsely relate the image from DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about violence against Rohingya, posts like the following written these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent imagery has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding pictures of a refusal equals to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, concern is that violent pictures and viewers desensitise and give them the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study that investigates how violent media works to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be derived from the context or completely abusive."</seg>

<seg id="946">"some of these unsettable words are already well-known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others, deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sobremesa)."</seg>

<seg id="948">"a word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices recently reported about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities, accept diversity - secure spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"during" listening "often connected with it," "purposes of these events" "instead" "listening to feel" "to feel, to touch."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and depiction lead to the fact that the audience lets itself on it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the hare and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the importance of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is that to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took up to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in mass demonstration last April, 2017; the march started in the Dominican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran down to the Plaza de Col√≥n in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was called out by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditor√≠a de la Deuda" (B√ºrgerfront for the neural testing of the debt) and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, banks and government officials are responsible for debt to be accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand financial scrutiny and a management committee without personal interests at public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which is in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is said:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge, and what are the real costs associated with."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet Volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the Military Tribunal of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by individuals on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his residence and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps, none of Basque's cultural prototypes were more forward than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began to work with this work, the IS would do everything about this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysria, but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strip into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public, as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my whole life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he taught other detainees to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other detainees how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually being in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a prosabbath, which she wrote to her husband between 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smugged the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Muslims responded with anger to a corruption incident, where a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his sentence, where corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010, together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good management and immediately requested his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which advertised the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, again to refer to his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary action after his arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Center for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade P√∫blica, abbreviated CIP), condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle."</seg>
<seg id="1262">"it is a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary case against the wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently was silent and did not induce appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Eg√≠dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case to be" disgusting. ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of which had been cut off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and pollute his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company he helped to harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Reluctantly!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"bitone viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil said, the director does not say any morality:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality to return to the state and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served solely by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a hand it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself, this man has become tired, who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splitting.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely valuable connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burmesan words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written in Burmesisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splendorbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression very but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook had to be more analytic before reading any posts that were suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spreading the hate speech, receive a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to copy, post and share content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community Standards" "failed."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions, or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author expressed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook before the start of the initiative should have done more, for example, asking the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censorship such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have been banned as words like" "chair" "or" "Erbsencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now thinking about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which did not include hate speech but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"post says" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where struggles between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for its failure, the proliferating hate speech on its burmese sites."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better on context rather than code concentrated initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1346">"this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as, each person under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and 18 were 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 from 1997 to 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, which were anxious to abolish laws on children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"however, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this rather uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the draft bill against the children's marriage was decided - in spite of 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and none of them decided against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once it has been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook Member Lovell Francis, who clothed a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and this is worth almost every price."</seg>
<seg id="1361">"while Abel Jackson believed that it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was at last:"</seg>
<seg id="1362">"public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:" "excellent news!"</seg>

<seg id="1365">"torture Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:"</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">"the amendment to the amendment to the marriage network was decided today, on 9 June 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"in the House of Representatives, there are 41 deputies and 35 of them were present at the vote."</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many techniques-versed Internet users are used to use change tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users are not in this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey was blocking articles by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>

<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform provided all the Turkish Wikipedia-pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>

<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a soothing rhinoceros, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and well-balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera in himself and try to grind the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">"at that time, he was still a child."</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese animal world onto the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as he helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"I just stopped at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti river was a leopard."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was in and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he was already standing by the face of the faces of the face toward face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buick appeared. he sat down right away, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyney and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should despise the norm to preserve this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a false court from the Indian state of Odisha and chased by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not mention the name, is also common among men. however, they have much less asperation to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff and housewives, came up with a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the Campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the mining of patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in its panel discussion, was women who did not name their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not saying the name of their husbands, is a custom that they owe all the duty and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not respect this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent until the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked everybody," "If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us, does that mean that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women must never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she giggled in front of herself during the whole exercise, and another decided to release all the angled frustration against him and his family by cursing it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received numerous reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called out Rohini, and asked what ideas she put on her head: his wife could not stop telling his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini thought I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnographic point on the forehead, which indicates the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnod point if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion with every club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what", "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never talked so honest about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salted curta, a wide shirt over a pant, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing choice, morality linked with the Saris and much more, Rohini smugged their own couple of curtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini confirms that things slowly come to roll in the five months since their first discussion has changed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only taken small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women rehearsed it a few times, but then again listened to the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and not other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives, such as the gripping for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1549">"on June 29th of this year, the Hashtag (Beatles Memorial Day) was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles."</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in Japan in 1966 is considered a reversal of the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">"the first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:"</seg>
<seg id="1552">"for just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through."</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"the music of the cult band is" more than just a universal language like English, "Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review."</seg>
<seg id="1556">"good morning!: today the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan. by 51 years ago, they were here in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="1557">"even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools."</seg>

<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">"and as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band."</seg>

<seg id="1572">"exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On were on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same we did last year too.</seg>

<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of single-headed people for organ trading, probably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of Zamb√©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could discover gold or bring wealth, explained the police spokesman Zamb√©zia of the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"this led to a mission conducted by the UN in 2016 in the South African country, to investigate this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"the persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices."</seg>

<seg id="1597">"two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place."</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of single-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zamb√©zia, for probably superstitious rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the riches."</seg>
<seg id="1601">"in recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country."</seg>

<seg id="1627">"this story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press."</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community, after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" "Subversion" "after having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that prompted democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "an internal matter" "and tells a spokesman that he considers it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should put pressure in order to enable Liu abroad to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Belgium</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B√∏rge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway got stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government informed that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony he was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she said in an explanation on 30 June:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife as well as family members."</seg>

<seg id="1651">United States</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US embassy drew a furious response from China, with the utterance of the State Department that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, according to Chinese Constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>
<seg id="1658">"I demand China to unconditionally release the Nobel prize winner # LiuXiaobo, so that he can move into a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo"</seg>

<seg id="1660">"the German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on 3 July, Berlin hopes that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. ""</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared at the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">"previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns, whether the vortex for Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum invited China to provide appropriate medical care to Liu and give him the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Lius attorney told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always oversees the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release these rights for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France (EN)</seg>
<seg id="1669">"on 29 June, France's Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="1670">"all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where, needed. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there was no further information whether France would eventually receive it."</seg>

<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the ill intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June at Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for his well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished, would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly because Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark provoked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "turn the logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a duty of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of this, it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the topic, the good old Leier appears again from the authoritarian makers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He warned these questions in a rational way with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country is our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clear this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon published his commentary on the blog, he points out regarding the criticisms that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said," "Be not a country," "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least, I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugham's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian proponent?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the Cabinet of Government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore, has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear testimonies, such as" "the defence of the country, above all", "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is most asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is deemed to be polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification often follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians perhaps cook in fear of anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1747">"this is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack, when they travel."</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: to be called" "nice" "is basically to be fun - just like the good-natured, gentle but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(which has one's own Canadian Doppelg√§nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really were a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"that can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main part of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as' nice 'is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence along with the neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that the Junta parody, which in 2014 took power and despite its promise to restore the civil government, the country still reigns."</seg>
<seg id="1781">"the new song" Dictator Girl "(Phadet Girl), the Band tattoo, describes a young man who tells the rules about his girlfriend."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not expressly political, the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"within the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,254 times and received 8,800 lights."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inparticular how it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the drakonical section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making authority over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program of" setting change "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest militants and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, which monitors online content and prosecuted persons who accused the monarchy to have been prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict "Lese Majeste" (Majestic Defense).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>

<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59th-year-old Mexican girl, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many of them under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez told the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also slept outside on boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buys them medicines that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Yoghurtbart) posing with Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the track and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his trip to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he has sold SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram√≠rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he replies, smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ram√≠rez told her guests often send text messages when they went to greet her, or to tell her about the course of her trip."</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but her guests have taught them to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez is very well known here, but she is not the only sparks hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes√∫s Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"in this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar a night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchenette outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula come from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to press money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him the roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the traveler quietly consulted their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ram√≠rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she puddles in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair lichens she has made an art girl, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she puts it in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users, can be used in the Valley of Commerce."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10th, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi got a mobile phone notification in which it indicates the District Government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web purification" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would establish and follow the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a service service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to inform users how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable government actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, afflicted ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet on Twitter based media outlet" Images from Al China, "published by censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers were randomly checking whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity thanks to the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" China "(TEST) released a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and therefore receives unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the Party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"an up-to-date report from Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole number of other possible treaties, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, although I didn't have done anything to make this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably originates from the cloaca.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner spared at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot keep your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams were not enough for him, so they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or if that belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables intertwined to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cabel."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour, three of them alternated, while I was still in the row."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner remarked the cooling and didn't find anything at all, why he grabbed an electrically charged staff."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect power conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which came to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." Raus with you, asshole. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausting youth:" "my Lord, my father needs to worry awful."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk away, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; at times he slips to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what you can rely on, a cigarette can be discovered between his fingers or his lips with nicotine."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (about: farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who is opposing the conservative majority and questioned their old tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics such as orialism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with its 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not openly admit it, he sweeps a special reluctance to U.S. foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, do anything with his identity as the" Palestinian "winged of the second generation," he said, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," Hdaib stresses. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think that because I am a human being, "while in water, Nescaf√© is poured into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the mud-warm coffee and the swaths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan, to drink water - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country, and the main reason for the concert tale."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputies and former press spokesmen of the Islamic Coalition, Dima Tahboub, said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many pretend that the engagement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not be easy to be rhetoric, but actually reflect an ever-clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib's traditional sex men moved to Leibe by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex before."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in Jordan, the number of 'honour killings' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings in 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan is still appalling that Jordan has failed to support institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for the crime of crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence must be held in prison for indefinite time, and for their release there is often a long-standing bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to do."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he admits that he is unable to separate his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come out of the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics intruded me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity. "</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one, in his words," can get what you want "- whether it be faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay men and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly censored until 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuda, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who was later to work on behalf of the Caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemian kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service arrested several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, with the reason they would have critically expressed the problems in social media comments related to the deep corruption rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's concert is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing" her. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streatunitions and art-led democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time is, Hdaib will continue to coat and therefore also resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman was a student Fellow."</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many parts of Tohokus. another theory states that the wagons, the drums and dancing have been surpassed over a thousand years, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to its knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>

<seg id="2156">"a joint center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two strollers are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has resulted in getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the School of Augusto Salazar Bondy, who are located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and receive training in the hair style instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel ejected to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely why the young Colombian activist Leonardo P√°rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation did not come out of the head and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la reconciliaci√≥n (Letters to Reconciliation) who encouraged young people to write errilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla war FARC (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the clue of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signatory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jos√© Manuel Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombian people, however, there is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillakev, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock carrying their weapons, must now be re-integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, adapted to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters, to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will then be delivered personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC got up as they had done before to accept the instructions of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in between," said the political scientist Manuela Jim√©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warriors live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed an MGL shell was lying, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I asked him anyway and said," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody has written something so nice, so I answer it." "I suddenly ran into tears of the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down beside the garnets.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how the social injustice by the State on the whole of Colombian people has emanated. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country fairer. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster and even hate me, are only people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - including those who killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the camp commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people willing to take up arms to stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which hangs just like a Damocleshift above the local LGBTQ community, did not come into existence only overnight."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken over the international headlines several months ago, after reports published that aggravated the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their countrywoman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear for her life, she moved into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there is no more men in Chechnya, who can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos from my documents took the lap through the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying," "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long will you return the family, du Schandfleck? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that there was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up the last end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had got everything along and started crying."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called up an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which nursing homes, you were laid - in the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it, but the doctor understood and laid me down to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked me absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family manage to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only humiliated your family, but the entire Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother got too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment, and a few hours later, a car was placed under the window with a window of windows and a number plate with a number of 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that there was a little lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"I don't want to reveal their names for safety reasons, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering me, without notice, without notice."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think you would be safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditionally Caucasian items, I still carry in myself."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with a camera, I really try to look like the person looking out from her past - i.e. my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have been dordant?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has settled in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this, I mean, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so-called" "honour" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: an acquaintance of me says there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then most of all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to ask Kadyrows court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are captured there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show off their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but purposely dipped to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard has grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was themselves when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think that before 2003 I was already known in quite Grosny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civilisation", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes and wore Skinny jeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia never hurt me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and all the city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say to children, when they make fun of the sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they closed their eyes to you, because they believed they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended, never chased and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us by se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who laughed and laughed before, watched you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I clapped the places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans who have, the Kabardines, who, the Russians, have whatever; on the whole planet they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I'm from there, so it's uncomfortable to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims going to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think in terms of transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of self-killings within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"a video, shared on YouTube, held the moments when he had lit up himself."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegam hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patters who were helpless and incapable of feeding their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of pursuing their families and to pursue a safe job."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, in which most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"before a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power, and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy all over Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets very little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime denies the Ahwazi Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of tribes, the waters of Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi young people now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have university degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livelihood outside their home of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their name and surname in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and be employed, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activist alarm goes before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afrof√©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - are acting with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">The fact that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer twice and threefold."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to skin color, on racism, on black women's women, black women in the LGBTI community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been misused under racial segregation and discrimination; if I mention how we have always been misused by racial segregation and discrimination, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have to be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" raise their voices and "Kumbaya, my lord" to sing, "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about sexualised violence, in addition to sexualized violence, an institutionalized form of racist motivating violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or, that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with migration background are more often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color equal rights; on the other hand, I can't join myself as a black woman in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking, referring to both gender and skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851 Sojourner complained in her speech," Am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a simple and marginalized entity in an historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and differentiate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely and completely from feminism and to connect me to the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves (such as: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by focusing on our own way."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and marginalisation after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"Nabil Musa repeatedly travelled over the past 7 years, mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and water channels in Iraq as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we no longer had water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, little appreciable subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, whose help suppressed churches can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguays Women and their difficult fight against violence</seg>

<seg id="2480">The article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kurturally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# christlicheinefraubin) reported about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada B√°ez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another wife Balbuena pointed out because of ill-treatment, the actentious display of Ada B√°ez also used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved back her display."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women do not even refund, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, report themselves at all by law enforcement agencies."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"¬ß 1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system, which is not inhibiting 3 Paraguays law: good approach, flawed implementation of punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are various indications and reports, which, however, do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Prosecutor filed 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads reported by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. here too, 86% of women's advertisements came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements 40% of women said they were physically ill-treated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually displayed." "to any woman that is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"there are two women who do not do this," "she declared at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder is not a crime in Paraguay, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists recorded at least 12 cases of murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then she said. this should always repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would ever be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they can be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulted her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other facebook users asked Mariana why they had such a long time of Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner handled them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" I believe you "), consisting of women who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"finally, her wealthy partner was able to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result, and also from their relatives, they did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay's laws: good approach, flawed implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the announcement of mistreatment is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament under the hashtag # PorEllas (# f√ºrst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-newcomers) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">"the original draft of the law foresees to explain and punish Femizid for an independent existence and to punish harshly, as is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia."</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the Code of Law has been modified in some respects to also win the MPs for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is denied, which are fundamentally prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill foresaw the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, which must be borne by the victims of violence themselves, if they just want to refund only ad and maintain a secure accommodation to the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, abuse is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators will get away."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund so long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed on in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered, among other things, a passage that the partners in cases called domestic violence for reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"however, the submission of the words" gender, "" political violence "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law is regarded as a great setback."</seg>

<seg id="2552">"the Sultans' rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic secret services, public freedoms, including freedom of press, to restrict and incarcerate human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers, and other activists."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustrated with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need for medical research on site, there are two reasons: for one thing missing in the offer of global healthcare many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more severe in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the investigation of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the sambish health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on applying research results. I support the sambish national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just stared a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"that has to change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being a maker himself."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"lab equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which are facing challenges."</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that periodicals make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how open source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine reported about solutions for environmental issues around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrage, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the early 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or card varieties. because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate exponent of a millennia of old tradition Morton still breeds salad, but he now needs longer because his work gets more and more difficult due to more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river it is a boulder lying around which I must triumph.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new kind of salad because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and does not endeavor to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement which is growing in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source "Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tube salat of the variety Outrage in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source) is inspired by the free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders are able to commit to free use of seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders do only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many pesticides."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seeds, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants may be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "says he and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardised as the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights available on plant material, which is therefore always available, unceasingly shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted attributes - from such, by which their taste or colour improves until such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever, as the changed conditions are much worse predictible due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts the notion that intellectual property confers other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but fosters it by providing the public with more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent expels, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it becomes impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"on the whole, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and OSSI, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "whoever breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, are required to grow massy herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) have patents, they manage to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they refuse the patenting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-breeder Frank Morton looks for Salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeder through the avoidance of plant patentations would be more innovative:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves," he says. "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which one makes it very easy for my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be leading in the" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol is working on an open source license, which ultimately marks a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding are different from country to country, therefore the OSSI obligation cannot be simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; it is now on the Member States Governments to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's" Open Source "seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group to erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report published by McKnight Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context, by the Luby of OSSI, hopes that soon more people will be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government opened the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about it."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains btw - despite this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, it has never been as important as it is now."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web pages, e.g. the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language version of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network based on alleged" support of terrorism. ""</seg>

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ziada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of articles and articles, which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, which is native to the also Ziadas blog, is still accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, as police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself about the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to lock blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi's priority; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege; A arrest, a tempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, though only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities locked up from May 24 to August 06, 133. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"moreover, afte documented the blocking of vendors, through the enveloping of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs were offering began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block content and filter, which Egyptian users could have access."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions behind closed doors are made, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against these acts of action."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the Brazilian army was deployed in the favelas in Niter√≥i, a city in Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos p√∫blicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"day for day newspapers in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school shot," "For the second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "Vine robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers in the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a strained financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the paper" Extra "published in Rio for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16, published the editorial" That is not normal "in which it announced to set up a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crime, etc. everything, but what happens to the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, is published in the category" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists don't close our eyes before cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision is not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"the same video explains a journalist from the newspaper, that according to the Institute of Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes further:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" say more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cec√≠lia Oliveira arguing against the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education, and a historical and self-complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">The state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to Cec√≠lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date data. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"if we look at the morale rates per federal state, Rio is on No. 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"it is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cec√≠lia, has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Pol√≠cia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a Favela by using a massive police station and permanently stationed there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page journalist Jo√£o Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not match the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio also draws serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to employ means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civilian is an unclear point in the landscape and becomes an object for" "collateral damage" "and" "mistaken globes". ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war on or off, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">"in the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchartist died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the United Nations and other human rights organisations have committed the massacre of Assad's regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, those areas controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus, causing inhabitants to rely on locally manufactured or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Direction of the Project, Abo Nabil, spoke to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project more known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda the humanitarian crowdfunding platform cando."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about 12.700 ‚Ç¨, but will continue to collect donations to cando until Monday, 04 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ¬∞ C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally manufactured fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with" "production from the regions of mushroom seeds" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread mushrooms throughout East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons:" "fracture of siege."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people protested on October 21 in many districts of Portugal, and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were in the north of Portugal in the week before."</seg>
<seg id="2834">"forty-two people died and about 70 were injured in the wake of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the last week, the government proclaimed a state of state of solidarity with the victims for 3 days."</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also recorded in the region of Galicia, Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 quarries, spread in the northern and central areas of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, in Pedr√≥g√£o Grande, a similar tragedy took place in Pedr√≥g√£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon."</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire prevention measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People asked themselves why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Jo√£o Soveral from the Federation of farmers of Portugal explained the paper P√∫blico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedr√≥g√£o, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2850">"Leiria's forest would have had a similar tragedy like in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in places with high fire risk are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the whale form, which the government introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built," Jo√£o Sorval continues in the same article in the newspaper P√∫blico. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, are still spreading like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this species."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems are added to the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives, offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo√£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers had not stopped the 400.000 users who followed the fires, while the site counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2873">"in one night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban."</seg>
<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups, who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>
<seg id="2876">"even if his mother didn't tell it at that time, she knew she wouldn't see her son very long - maybe even more."</seg>
<seg id="2877">"in the morning, the boy was to break up."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hezbollah, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many of Hazara were suddenly futile."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found herself in Pakistan again."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal mine. work was difficult and made him ill."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"once again, he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in a standing building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't refresh at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf made his life without documents in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing over the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for the past asylum seekers due to relatively high levels of protection. however, it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The civil rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "this is improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who don't have money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbounded lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after having worked several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some Afghans have sprung up, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the restaurant's menu tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"however, Asharafs's goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country which he had to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a Kabul factory in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "thus they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"Asharaf has made this journey itself, and now he wants to help other Afghans on this path."</seg>

<seg id="2931">"global Voices Advocacys Netizen's report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights"</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">"in order to be able to use social networks, users would have to register within six months following the legislative decree on the authority's website, stating their full name and identification number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step might be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the depletion of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was advertised by sixty members of the Parliament, is currently under legislative and the constitutive Committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of the Parliament filed a proposal to introduce the tougher penalties for the accusation of the President or a senior official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the law proposition, such a deed would be punished with prison and money punishments, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the sentenced."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in jeopardy for many years anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he held violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup committed against the elected president Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a trial."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to May 20, because the prison administration in accordance with human rights groups failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, false exposure, among other things, weapons of possession, illegal assembly, murder and sublatting murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza was speaking the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the penalties of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunesischer activists listen to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia has been largely interrogated to a continuous action plan. said Plan comes from the President of the Republic, which, according to the plan expressly supports a controversial bill of legislation, the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials of amnesty, provided they return all unlawful monies."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document released on 21 April on Nawaat's website, sheds light on how the presidential schemes look like to support the legislative process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia leaned the naming of his sources stating articles 11 of the Tunisian press code, which gave journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on the 9th of May as a witness in the case."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to new regulations by the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in the rules, it is also stated that registration with full real name will be required."</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that hereby the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these provisions only selectively, in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence."</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in May, state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging App WeChat."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat refused to register as a" organiser of information distribution. ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">"this term is part of a statute from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that will organize the publication of information."</seg>
