this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA had illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation , in which the CIA literally delivered dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been established against cracks and promp@@ ted him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive such information , and if they cannot protect the need@@ y they disclose . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous rep@@ or@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , tears lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had for years that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped on cracks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the rep@@ or@@ ters and sources can be hidden less and less .
&quot; instead of sh@@ aking and crus@@ hing , this could also do with his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , have kept his phone numbers secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail dates , financial and bank information , his credit meeting , and even travel advice on the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and tears supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all U.S. governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which had not yet been written as a crack of his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet world , the Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; you can upload documents or send information , just like any common contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is up to us to ensure that not only technology components such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to apply mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers , who wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environment lab@@ our@@ ers who are alert to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der , who warned us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others waiting excit@@ ingly for the next release , and to the next un@@ revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to be we@@ eping away from you , me , common people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states it is necessary to give less information , less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of transparency in the United States allows employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked us that all , up to a lawyer , made suggestions as to how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single leading politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ cky , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a safe optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen incidents of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at national level who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made an outlet store . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace @-@ scor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get on ? &quot;
a stranger sleep@@ eth in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , f@@ ished at the door and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; today , the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people , who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost pl@@ unge , my ro@@ ommate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate , Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the lock , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into the roll .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ k@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it .
&quot; we asked the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when a visit comes . &quot;
&quot; via the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one contempl@@ ates the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the total experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locking mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this sil@@ ently flying from panic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests also feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; so , who actually has Al Gore mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he can@@ di@@ ted for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor first introduced himself with his name , if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he really can hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait for both host and guest leaving their assessments before placing them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated , how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we trust the people who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you buy . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you talk too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother . &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards strangers .
&quot; with what we did not expect , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is very good . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were allowed to celebrate parties or rav@@ aged homes .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment you heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was , and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem . &quot;
for people are familiar with each other .
&quot; when trust works , there can be won@@ dro@@ us things . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his evaluation :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who can save life , even though they don &apos;t know it properly . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is going on . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a commercial trade .
&quot; but now it is just &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; if you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you were visiting , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub tour of which one has never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up for sharing ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of common participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relations , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot;
are now available to residents . students who were looking for a stay
&quot; were given to people whose children were with@@ drawn . incub@@ ator programs have been started , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreig@@ ner or even host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality has already existed before .
there were already similar websites to us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for the future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or just a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ cian , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual mus@@ cul@@ ine .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I felt like 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adjust myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understands and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , I lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock turned quickly into indign@@ ation .
why should I do something like this ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned into a susp@@ ects from others . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate study . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I sat down -- as we rode silent -- as deep as I walked into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims and beat and beat them . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to asser@@ t itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people saying , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ques . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; it will perhaps hold some parking lots , but do not stop terror . &quot;
regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant people &apos;s people and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as I recently told a director of the police in the Washington , DC area recently , people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . any spiritual man with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring it into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept in mind to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; one study shows : if you submit news reports in which negative Muslims were reported , they rather voted for military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims sli@@ pped up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear avo@@ ids all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Yus@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her , just as the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he s@@ wo@@ ke eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the fo@@ yer , and what I saw was stopped . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is just about becoming a milli@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air distribution entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flight devices , they reach high speed and acceleration in the narrow@@ est space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ confident structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear bur@@ dens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to autonom@@ ously work , it has to be collec@@ tively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a fe@@ eder of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space and determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; attention european and german buyers : we allow you to bid on this auction , but you need to add the vat of 19 % . Shipping to a
one flight unit trying to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other high @-@ speed drives , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ches , it can float , and therefore has great advantages in the start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that come to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flying devices that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ator or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear brake . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it exactly right when I watch everyone is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in nau@@ sea , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that &apos;s why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , it ob@@ tains the most au@@ dac@@ ious ability , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be seen in models , the rest will be learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at this .
&quot; if aircraft engines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is clock@@ wise .
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something is wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can even fly the machine even if constra@@ ined . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercially available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine is going to be a flying lamp screen . &quot;
of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the wage is in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y cir@@ cled each other faster , so the mass of three suns were converted into pure energy in a tenth place . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lighted bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; first of all , we arrange the events in time . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , a number of lives were created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courage@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which improved the recognition performance enorm@@ ously . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes smoked through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , it was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a crum@@ bling in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when over@@ hanging the shaft , the room and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and st@@ amped into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ched by us at the meeting of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : face lifts , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can make a picture or a map of things by exercising the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; in case of sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that give you a great deal : &quot;
approximately the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob is inter@@ rup@@ ting them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least Lig@@ o are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity , about the coll@@ ision of two black holes can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ate simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies turn very quickly , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement wor@@ ding , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forgot -- heard Lig@@ o following : &#91; surround sound &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what he has to hear , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in the universe , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve around a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space can we not see -- practically or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through as these are op@@ aque .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ g@@ low . &quot;
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves should be able to look back to the beginning .
&quot; the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies of prehistoric times . black holes are the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and finally on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , and removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; yes , &quot; my life changed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life deeply , on an unexpected item . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning
&quot; from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sag@@ a for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am an author . I think of things , consider life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I &apos;m responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each program offers hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run one another on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not just produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing this ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are now directing a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , take a business or household , take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so you understand that I &apos;m not just typ@@ ing around on the computer and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand it &apos;s dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I deep@@ en into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , as I set up troops , as I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one has a high sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a sum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I declare to them the sums that I speak about writing , that writing makes me happy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the hum@@ ming -- when I started to work and work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the tot@@ em is action and activity . the tot@@ em is a drug .
the tot@@ em is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the tot@@ em is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ ming , you can &apos;t look different from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sum@@ ming .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is a genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say that I am a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum@@ ming , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the tot@@ em .
am I just this sum ?
and then the tot@@ he stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burnt out . &quot;
the tot@@ he stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single employer .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum ceased . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t like my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked out weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sl@@ ats not , does not give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz was me .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid Author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you &apos;re working , you love what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the bu@@ zz feels when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; presents me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say No when two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot;
she calls no one more &quot; estimate . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I hate it when I am Titan and my sums are bet@@ ting , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes into letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; not immediately , but it happened , it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the tot@@ em comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the tot@@ em , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working sum , the title sums , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and tel@@ ev@@ isions and how dys@@ functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the tot@@ em is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not the way to play as to how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person would prefer to be as a home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we sm@@ ashed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel predominantly sti@@ ff@@ led , absent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever listened to playing ?
you can also say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is just 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird replaces me or bis@@ cuit .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; anyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes in the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming of having a place for peace . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure .
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I will fail and I si@@ ege . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is just about everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the tot@@ em came back in my spare time . the tot@@ em seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself back in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz , the sum is not me ... not anymore . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
&quot; the hum@@ ming of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is snow@@ y to me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer it is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ ming . the land I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the sum@@ ming , the other , the right sum : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life is spreading in me . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am an author . I think of things , I am stir@@ ring you to life . &quot;
&quot; that is part of the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions .
&quot; certainly they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby , one implant@@ ing a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help herself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
&quot; you have to imagine that cran@@ ium @-@ brain trau@@ mas inf@@ ects the brain , and the skull pressure is rising . &quot;
&quot; to save life , it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by doing so ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells just as it did in Jean @-@ François . &quot;
then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we stri@@ pped of it at the reception point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we irrit@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we irrit@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we stri@@ pped the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we put an injury and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were irrit@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we in vitro , in the culture col@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we achieved the manual motor skills in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they spontan@@ eously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ ci@@ zed brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the monkeys that spontan@@ eously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we spread the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you this was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them with human beings .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and attempted permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to conduct the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ entr@@ al study . &quot;
&quot; first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ti@@ ck@@ ness .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his major im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is absolutely possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- has made me un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs that have been realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for a genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies will bri@@ ghten our future and w@@ asted our magnificent , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summ@@ its parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who casts his long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but only a few realize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which , however , is too scar@@ ce to invest there where it would be productive and contribute to producing the debt mountain and also producing all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months , in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate stock prices and boost real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summ@@ its , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe job@@ less , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , increases the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in a final loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he is growing , &quot;
&quot; un@@ inten@@ tionally cause the circumstances , which cause the body to kill him . &quot;
that is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; his most extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting balance in questions of state p@@ liers . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long held --
&quot; like a candle that g@@ lows very bright , it is burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a full separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our democr@@ acies , since the time that this separation between politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , as the economy slowly under@@ goes politics and depri@@ ves it . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government , and yet not in power because the power of politics is wi@@ ped into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably sustain@@ s the animals from which it feeds them , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has stream@@ lined politics itself so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the economic demand falls , and the general manager of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains the control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the theory of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union was to be that the working arms could reg@@ ain a position just as in ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is a solution : abol@@ ishing the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separated , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the extravag@@ ance of people and the social conflicts go deeper , like it -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ arrange the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and pay attention to the fact that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; appear like a documentation . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve humans and humans serve their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to indul@@ ge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it look like to have this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you , in a nut@@ shell , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one company to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income comes from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who owns the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no emp@@ tied twin summ@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging economies &#93; in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call them &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , in particular against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe you is at the same time the Liber@@ al , in which they prefer privileged individuals , and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t feel good , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s viewpoint on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we limited democracy limited to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember@@ ing -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was especially scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China now is similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to present China now , to do what the West did in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge in hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Minister of Finance in Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I warned that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; let us say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line has passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- who , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , have continued to deny the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what comes . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not survi@@ vable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example , Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has not made any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika of the don@@ ors who imposed this policy on us stood , &quot; &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not only have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to follow the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be int@@ ol@@ erable for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you that you were at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; from Roy Price , most of them have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fris@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content to produce Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy could not choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the site . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating .
&quot; if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium exc@@ itation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t wow . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create achievements .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everybody free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if you get out of Amazon for free stuff , do you access right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are looking at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you can record when to start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p and check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and hence the answer is , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com of four repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7,5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the ratings they give the shows their course , whatever shows they like . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com of four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; receives a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is somewhat sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know about the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , are you in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data vers@@ ed companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict break@@ through@@ s of flu , the bad type , by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year by year , until suddenly it was no longer working , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data most accomplished companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data streams flow into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in legal translation , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know a lot of difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; do you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , break this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do it several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to an end .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision , especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but deciding how to put all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that wasn &apos;t in the data . &quot;
&quot; Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
before there was data this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will evaluate it later with a technical demo .
&quot; I have made some decisions so far in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays out to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
