<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation, in which the CIA literally delivered drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been established against cracks and prompted him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive such information, and if they cannot protect the needy they disclose."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, tears lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had for years that it would be essential to their case, the demands of the government were dropped on cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can be hidden less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of shaking and crushing, this could also do with his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his understanding, have kept his phone numbers secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail dates, financial and bank information, his credit meeting, and even travel advice on the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and tears supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned him more than all U.S. governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of whistleblowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which had not yet been written as a crack of his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet world, the Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can upload documents or send information, just like any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is up to us to ensure that not only technology components such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to apply misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers, who wants to report about overcrowded hospitals. or the next environment labourers who are alert to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall Street insider, who warned us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous enterprise. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people and others waiting excitingly for the next release, and to the next unrevealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent writer or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be weeping away from you, me, common people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortune in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states it is necessary to give less information, less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the United States allows employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked us that all, up to a lawyer, made suggestions as to how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leading politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very tricky, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a safe optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen incidents of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need managers in the economy that stand up and say," "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leaders who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I once almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made an outlet store."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace-scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard myself saying," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what did I get on? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleepeth in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, fished at the door and closed my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"today, the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people, who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost plunge, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate, Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure our cheese-ham omelettes tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the lock, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blekczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we asked the investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when a visit comes. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"via the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one contemplates the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the total experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocking mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silently flying from panic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is even more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests also feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"so, who actually has Al Gore mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he candited for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor first introduced himself with his name, if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he really can hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait for both host and guest leaving their assessments before placing them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated, how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we trust the people who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you buy."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you talk too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother. "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm doing holiday with my family. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we did not expect, the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is very good."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were allowed to celebrate parties or ravaged homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment you heard in the voice of the caller was, and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are familiar with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, there can be wondrous things."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who can save life, even though they don't know a lot."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is going on."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is just" "rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you were visiting, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub tour of which one has never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable society and relations, rather than loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Are now available to residents. students who were looking for a stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were given to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs have been started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the share economy. today, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time when a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for the future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness-fanatician,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual musculine.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born like that."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," "Why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I felt like 17-year-old, to adjust myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understands and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, I lived basically the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical failure?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists...,"... "in the name of Islam...,"... "..."... "Jihad...," "..." "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the acts of others turned into a suspects from others."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Middle East of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate study."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I sat down -- as we rode silent -- as deep as I walked into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't be sampled. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims and beat and beat them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to assert itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people saying," There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympioniques."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it will perhaps hold some parking lots, but do not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant people's people and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I recently told a director of the police in the Washington, DC area recently, people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to their imagination, when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. any spiritual man with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring it into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept in mind to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows: if you submit news reports in which negative Muslims were reported, they rather voted for military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims slipped up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear avoids all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the case of the assignment of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He swoke eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be fatal not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and went out of my shoes, and went into the foyer, and what I saw was stopped."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air distribution entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at FRAC Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks before the public. a few years ago they started flying with ropes."</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build self-confident structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to autonomously work, it has to be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a feeder of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space and determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>

<seg id="424">"unlike most starches, it can float, and therefore has great advantages in the start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that come to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled flying devices that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuator or controller surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear brake. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it exactly right when I watch everyone is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in nausea, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That's why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it obtains the most audacious ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be seen in models, the rest will be learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if aircraft engines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something is wrong -- an engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- can even fly the machine even if constrained."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"on Broadway, the particularly safe machine is going to be a flying lamp screen."</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes in a very far distant galaxy circled each other faster, so the mass of three suns were converted into pure energy in a tenth place."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lighted brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"first of all, we arrange the events in time."</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, a number of lives were created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational-wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following time, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which improved the recognition performance enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes smoked through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, it was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crumbling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when overhanging the shaft, the room and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and stamped into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers in courses of relativity often lead to a really albering dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and punched by us at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average human was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: face lifts, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because you can make a picture or a map of things by exercising the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in case of sounds, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that give you a great deal:"</seg>
<seg id="512">Approximately the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "now Alice is talking." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupting them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least Ligo are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity, about the collision of two black holes can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulate simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"if the two bodies turn very quickly, one hears the same circus with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement wording, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forgot -- heard Ligo following: [surround sound] Someone who knows what he has to hear, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest bodies in the universe, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve around a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space can we not see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">Gravitational waves should be able to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, in the first attempt, Ligo found things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, age-old bodies of prehistoric times. black holes are the dinosaurs for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and finally on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, and removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" yes, "my life changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, which changed my life deeply, on an unexpected item. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her, when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" saga for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am an author. I think of things, consider life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I'm responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run one another on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I have created myself and not just produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think if the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are now directing a company, a country or a classrooms, take a business or household, take me seriously if I'm talking about work so you understand that I'm not just typing around on the computer and fantasiere, and it's true when I say: I don't understand it's dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I deepen into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, as I set up troops, as I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, one has a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a summing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, if I declare to them the sums that I speak about writing, that writing makes me happy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the humming -- when I started to work and work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totem is action and activity. the totem is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totem is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totem is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a summing, you can't look different from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say that I am a titanium, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the summing, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the totem.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the tothe stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The tothe stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "guess, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sum ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same titans work, 15 hours-days, worked out weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a titanium slats not, does not give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl, stupid Author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you're working, you love what you do to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the buzz feels when the buzz stops, who is you?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" presents me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late, and she says," Mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say No when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" estimate. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no one more "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I am Titan and my sums are betting, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of humming, I can do nothing except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes into letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"not immediately, but it happened, it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The totem comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the totem, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working sum, the title sums, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and televisions and how dysfunctional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totem is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the buzz again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not the way to play as to how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person would prefer to be as a home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smashed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel predominantly stiffled, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever listened to playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird replaces me or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"anyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming of having a place for peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I will fail and I siege. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" "is just about everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to meet myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totem came back in my spare time. the totem seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself back in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the buzz, the sum is not me... not anymore."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the humming of the work is part of me, but just a part. and for this I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is snowy to me that I am a titanium. I have never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer it is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the summing. the land I create, the marathon that I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the summing, the other, the right sum: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of life is spreading in me. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am an author. I think of things, I am stirring you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that is part of the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly they have heard of one of the most well known, the" deep brain stimulation. "thereby, one implanting a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help herself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine that cranium-brain traumas infects the brain, and the skull pressure is rising."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, you sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by doing so?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells just as it did in Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="853">Then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we stripped of it at the reception point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we irritate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we irritate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we stripped the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we put an injury and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we in vitro, in the culture coloring."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we achieved the manual motor skills in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plasticized brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we spread the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you this was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and attempted permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to conduct the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentral study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable tickness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his major imitators in Beijing proved that it is absolutely possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- has made me unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs that have been realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abolish if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for a genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves the democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies will brighten our future and wasted our magnificent, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of extravagance, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summits paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who casts his long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few realize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which, however, is too scarce to invest there where it would be productive and incapable of producing the debt mountain and also producing all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months, in the United States, England and the eurozone, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3,4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $5,1 trillion dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to inflate stock prices and boost real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summits, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe jobless, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in an endless loop, increases the pessimism of investors, which, as in a final loop, could be true that his son would kill him if he is growing,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally cause the circumstances, which cause the body to kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his most extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about the athenical democracy was and is that they involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they grant them the right to political co-determination with equal voting balance in questions of state pliers."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long held --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that glows very bright, it is burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only when a full separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies, since the time that this separation between politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place, as the economy slowly undergoes politics and deprives it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government, and yet not in power because the power of politics is wiped into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably sustains the animals from which it feeds them, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has streamlined politics itself so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the economic demand falls, and the general manager of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "retains the control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the theory of the debacle of the Soviet Union was to be that the working arms could regain a position just as in ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolishing the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separated, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the extravagance of people and the social conflicts go deeper, like it -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to rearrange the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and pay attention to the fact that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" "matrix" "appear like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of" matrix, "in which machines serve humans and humans serve their energy into the exploration of the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like to have this" "Star Trek" "like utopia instead of the" "Matrix" "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you, in a nutshell, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one company to another, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who owns the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no emptied twin summits."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging economies] in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, in particular against the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe you is at the same time the Liberal, in which they prefer privileged individuals, and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mülleimer of history, and Keynesian, globally keynesianese."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand what Larry Summers called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore, I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't feel good, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly stated what you think of the West's viewpoint on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we limited democracy limited to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I can say this provocatively, China resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remembering -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China now is similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to present China now, to do what the West did in the 19th century, smells huge in hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Minister of Finance in Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I warned that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"let us say good-bye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive fault line has passed through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- who, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, have continued to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what comes."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not survivable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">"BG: for example, YV: everybody who looks back -- seriousness..."</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has not made any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions going through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika of the donors who imposed this policy on us stood," "This was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not only have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to follow the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will also be intolerable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you that you were at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"from Roy Price, most of them have never heard before, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content to produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought sector."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy could not choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the site. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where after watching a season, your brain asks:" where is there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you what is going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium excitation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't wow."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everybody free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if you get out of Amazon for free stuff, do you access right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are looking at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can record when to start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip and check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and hence the answer is, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom of four republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7,5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix viewer, so the ratings they give the shows their course, whatever shows they like."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these small details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a car and decided not to make a sitcom of four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" receives a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is somewhat scary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know about the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, are you in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data versed companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could predict breakthroughs of flu, the bad type, by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year by year, until suddenly it was no longer working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most accomplished companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data streams flow into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in legal translation, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know a lot of difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"do you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, break this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do it several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision, especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but deciding how to put all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards, "that wasn't in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, when they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will evaluate it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions so far in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays out to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
