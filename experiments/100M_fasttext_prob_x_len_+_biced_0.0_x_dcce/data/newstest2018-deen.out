Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is now du@@ g .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories .
it anno@@ ys if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took on a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria in the state government , are anything but current - but precisely therefore very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a rag rug that you don &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; the large map shows more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional She@@ ets . &quot;
these were created according to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer survey@@ ing management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; since spring 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria into order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove forward the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Compar@@ ative Management . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheet for Munich origin@@ ates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of the former / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map , i.e. 1877 , in the district of Munich . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasants &quot; uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the west park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming , a small piece card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ numbered hall@@ marks from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pri@@ mor@@ dial &quot; &quot; from which the land was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are little plots there today no more farmers - but small farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheet one reads in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street names &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or at the top &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße there were once people locked up with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , ended the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who dealt with the institution for an exhibition . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , first place had been place , later on 500 places were expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k pension in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest atri@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth shelter with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - in architectural references to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War with bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main place , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Allied bom@@ b@@ ings seized many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a mining chapel from the Middle Ages were once again at the Mari@@ enhof where this day was the preliminary work and the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn trunk road on 5 April 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the slider bar , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizens Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to Promot@@ e Far@@ ran has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents have recently been found throughout the state and noted here , &quot; said the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted Bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discrimination compl@@ aining , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state who are di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue travel warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights which happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the At@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General Office , showing that black mot@@ oring in the state is 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring them with interest or let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i signed 100 Hass@@ an Break@@ s , according to the latest figures from the FBI report programme of the FBI that classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states have adopted immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violation , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in view of the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;
fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher pasture fence project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag members Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have presented themselves on the spot .
&quot; at the rec@@ ess courtyard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ates in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ir@@ th . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is for him the alternative commerci@@ alization path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
at the table of the holiday @-@ guests only regional .
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ president of Fischer@@ bach , he called the fence project as &quot; &quot; fundamental &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such steep faces .
&quot; green area care for a lot of work , much needed to be mach@@ ined with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography to fight , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if he did not lead a bio farm . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they carry out their operations , &quot; &quot; said Mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 71 500 were promoted , a quarter contributed to the community of fishermen . &quot;
&quot; thus , farmers stayed 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives it is not possible . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art sponsor@@ ship of pasture fence .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of a sponsor@@ ship designated by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the f@@ enced area must not be tra@@ des@@ i@@ able ( slope incl@@ ine above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ bacher Wei@@ ghing project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 parking spaces , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ hold area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ g@@ ime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the pres@@ idency &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he touched on their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after finishing the monument , has been added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem to which you refer to will be added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibr@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , and your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the ending waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; moving waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
&quot; this conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America . &quot;
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had done a high political action .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism , portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical form . &quot;
&quot; Laz@@ arus also changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly like Laz@@ arus had changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this long ago . &quot;
&quot; the great cry R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one , but rather an early neo@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the re@@ adi@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative action of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of men seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , which is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black kno@@ cks Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally occ@@ ured was great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete with her fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the medium @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir carries on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman for the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembered her first world champion@@ ships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the team captain says that she is &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of her fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on Po@@ dium . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there , and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block Kri@@ tik@@ ern via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the n@@ atives of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ ou@@ ted in the cri@@ tique , certainly . &quot;
but he did not have his critics sil@@ enced .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
&quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union promised him this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary ho@@ of @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rig@@ orous adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - is a public forum , which is designated officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ole people who vibr@@ ate on the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans of Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; I commented cour@@ te@@ ously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s employees called as &quot; concentrated spam &quot; attack , others would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or del@@ eting a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ t@@ orials and to arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was Virginia last week .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she appointed a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of paper hit his lead . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that settled Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comforts in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year joined the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ usen before losing Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
I won &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home soil . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
I am happy about how it went .
&quot; the trio in the field is the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , parking costs £ 5 per car with an in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smo@@ kers
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and , &quot; &quot; lie somewhat in the time , &quot; &quot; says the head of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is a lot of ver@@ ges in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which constantly hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the building tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and lock@@ outs is already enormous , &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o and Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately , we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with a cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ency in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the fo@@ al bul@@ b is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture , where she performs her daily work , e.g. washing dresses with cloudy water from nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 p.m. , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces in 1969 . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red against Dutch rule for independence , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea to the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is o@@ ily . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and out of corrug@@ ated roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust into different yellow tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans hon@@ ed a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright Rock . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has min@@ ed in value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
&quot; more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been tort@@ ured , tort@@ ured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969 . &quot;
&quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal region in the 1970s , in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , became genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will sum@@ mon everything &quot; &quot; in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year contain , such as un@@ lawful execution and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week passes , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic change is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who went to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua , the mo@@ m @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - cost their market . &quot;
&quot; Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took imp@@ etus on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting arches and carried out the Wa@@ ita dance - in a circle continuously and a bird song im@@ itated - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters started to spin stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; stated in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of K@@ ego K@@ oto &apos;s quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said in the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only carries a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him .
&quot; chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters that his officers would only &quot; secure &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings occurred only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate talk in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic ab@@ err@@ ations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he would include an out @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ years .
&quot; the point is that we are obliged to address these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sum@@ med up by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody Declaration of In@@ dependence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fier@@ y dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus re@@ claimed that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the found@@ ries have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s office .
the police said that vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warm sur@@ pl@@ uses .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the last ones have been delivered quickly , so TIME . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by cont@@ acting spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ class leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier of their migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or skills needed to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , head of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , limitations of reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were dep@@ orted due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permit for filming was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian foreign ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also attended the meeting , but wanted to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ es , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 metre high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , that one often calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant telling his name as George , Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) , and the building cooled down . &quot;
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve the security of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the fair@@ ing , outer cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was only to play a two @-@ thirds majority vote for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional rate . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of member countries agreed on reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; even before the vote , the proposal had already come to a neutral location after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next round in the next round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training plans etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media events before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden objects into the plane , finding a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously forbidden objects were sm@@ ug@@ gled past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that the aircraft entered while they acci@@ dentally wore prohibited kni@@ fes or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed they had been late discovered that they were mistaken with guns , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was conducted at more than 1,000 people - who was conducted by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;

&quot; the most common items that were pur@@ pos@@ ely passed on to T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently brought sm@@ ug@@ gling goods by airport security , and how many it had inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who wear sm@@ ug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most frequent . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
&quot; thus , it is no surprise that the largest amount of any liquid conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are fluids . &quot;
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
&quot; with the huge number of pre@@ positions for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 , &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy to offer . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k betra@@ yed a different , less brilliant figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the changes in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k adm@@ its : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ positions , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics repeatedly pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are present , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; it should be put together - all models - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who orders today a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; should expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never before tested production roads without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if it comes to major delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent un@@ happy customers from running away in flocks . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt pul@@ ls down due to the delay of the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environment Protection Authority , with@@ drew his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g induced air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of government environmental agencies than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a period that ran for states on October 1 , in order to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the compliance for one year , to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regul@@ ating the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the entry regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator had exceeded its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA often has not adher@@ ed to dead@@ lines for execution and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to establish the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by trial , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that we give us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ made powers , &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reconstruction of the o@@ zone rules .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the saving and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Würt@@ t@@ ember@@ g@@ ische Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the &quot; &quot; Vog@@ tei &quot; &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; the wor@@ ding of the document was on the Tum@@ bler mountain apart from the former parish church , in addition to the former parish church , also a magnificent courtyard which belonged to the church or the patron and not revers@@ ed . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the local picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the splendid settlement core of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was originated from the early medieval O@@ wn Right .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied it with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; with this , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two pieces on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were carved and the bells were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aky .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops enc@@ amped near the church . &quot;
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius C@@ emetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary Church was ab@@ orted .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half fell .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted . &quot;
only the tower @-@ tower existing today remained a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant from the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Rent@@ ner &quot; &quot; as the successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as organisers , friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Freuden@@ stadt Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
&quot; for the seren@@ ade of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view of meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers discover the fantastic views . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant that is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
&quot; the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
association seeks to verify permission from wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim ref@@ uses &quot; &quot; does not see any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cil@@ or . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; has requested Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government in Düsseldorf was not approved because of a defect . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the informed approval en@@ vy is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to decline , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permission of the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the process to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - equivalent to roughly one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ size households . &quot;
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crashing down : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was killed in a mort@@ al manner .
two more persons were easily injured .
the Landes@@ straße remained closed over hours .
&quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city center . &quot;
&quot; the trade and municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the residents to the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the Chairman of the Professional , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers , which offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
city administration and trades unions are co@@ operating with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the trade industry and the city are going into a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all trade professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be newly or again developed . &quot;
guests and tourists belong to this .
but also many locals had lost the city center shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly became broader , king had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , agreed that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , takes part in five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and make its importance for the common welfare of our cities &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct environment .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine were injured , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a person died when a part of a school building crashed during the explosion .
a first missing was later recovered also dead .
&quot; in the case of the dead , they were employees of the school . &quot;
&quot; as an accident , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; at the holiday time , only a few people stayed in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , after transmitted tran@@ scripts from calls to Mexico , placed under pressure on account of the payment of the boundary walls &quot;
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , in a telephone conversation with Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , Tr@@ ump demanded that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President compl@@ ained because he den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an engaging exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia were &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would let him look like a &quot; &quot; de@@ pot &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull said &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ism as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rus@@ hed to the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and glan@@ cing through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates suspended in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged away from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizen rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to mim@@ ic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were killed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post@@ position . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that a wrong one has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician puts a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and neighbouring coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain vac@@ ant for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice stab@@ bed according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she wore , did not come from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they were then removed from the prison and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a ly@@ n@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fying the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a massacre &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual follow @-@ up of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , gri@@ pping and is founded in a kind of deep racism , of which many want to believe that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne , because we are confronted with its ug@@ ly in us all , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks crowded - in a room and were listening as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other hand of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett ho@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest cri@@ es and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said n --- he , w@@ aving from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona ow@@ es the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people have said &apos; n --- he &apos; .
&quot; but &quot; , &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely nobody laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are sh@@ outs , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a trau@@ ma , stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays tru@@ ing pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced George &apos;s op@@ pres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck in their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs , as if he remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his te@@ amm@@ ates and then breaks into her arms we@@ eping together ; the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience joins together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats talking about the night position with a black couple who just met her . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought for finding words which left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds me of the citizen rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the follow @-@ up is in a way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is as if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is sentenced to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ us@@ k &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;
&quot; the Swi@@ vel stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and don@@ key in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; c@@ aste and el@@ aste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ au@@ chter pos@@ ing as a rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that is through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ pf@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;

the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team was anticipated .

max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at different places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture market , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the Furniture Bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open all day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ work volunteer . &quot;
how does that come from ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it is wrong for me , and I want to do something different with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you are doing .
&quot; make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it &apos;s on the spot , maybe even in the focal point . &quot;
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social work . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;

Pear@@ son cuts additional 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure that the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job breakdown , which the Director General John Fall@@ on predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , additionally comes to its previous restructuring , with which 4,000 places have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans for a reduction of more than 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it achieved a gain of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and declared a statement by Nato .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion of Nato it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; man carried out of impro@@ vised explosive charges &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all wounded are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at Bag@@ ram airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban off power . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump has weak@@ ened , the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g rule after compl@@ aining
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has taken a decision to delay the regulation of Obama &apos;s government , which states that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states compl@@ ained because of the step@@ per . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ tage 2015 , &quot; and said they show the commitment of the agency to co @-@ operate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured to specify where inc@@ isions have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that an effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that should stimulate economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature groups who are concerned about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function &quot; &quot; and rein@@ force the respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
council wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln decides to set up a community room in the future retirement community . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports . &quot;
&quot; it will take a while until the area of the church is owned by the church community , but there is no plan of planning for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community room for this .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council were suspended , such a common room is not intended as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean housing , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the turn . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget last autumn , will be made by means of funding . &quot;
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , thus , T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the resolution proposed to signal the investor is that in this regard , no b@@ ill@@ ess between the legs wants to be thrown , the statement suggests that both saddle and back@@ roofs - which reduces the height and makes construction more economical - can be made possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , is this addi@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela Ruf points to the many own buildings that you don &apos;t get so much forward , but now you lean on the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard to do with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger den@@ oun@@ ces the community space - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but get a real , in doubt market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to ple@@ dge the proposed proposal , finds three app@@ reh@@ en@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; two counter @-@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we conclude the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police said , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road with his bike on the bik@@ eway of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from Hil@@ den on the road . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder rode on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that was steering a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup is taking place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory season of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel care of the German football record master Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ sieger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the BV@@ B with the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ horns Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the last six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the resin of star hike to star
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Way in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; to meet the needs of many har@@ p@@ visitors , was called it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic achievement . &quot;
the members want to stroll along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be supplemented by the internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection process . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star@@ path train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path the observer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; beginning in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of tracks ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the Earth shr@@ inks on a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is about 70 centimet@@ ers away exactly 75 meters away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with plugs . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fix , however , would take half a year . &quot;
&quot; Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia who were in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council light weight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super Fe@@ ather @-@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to get down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is the demand for the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to make a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also interests in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed openly about fighting on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he treasure Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stopped at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he &apos;s thinking of Ri@@ verside &apos;s three combat champion &quot; very slowly . I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to get the co @-@ off .
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show pot@@ ency , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Mr Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ gl@@ ers
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were injured in part hard on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane should be passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; triple @-@ chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann , after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to the season op@@ ener of Braunschweig , hopes that the optimisation of the defence formation in Au@@ e points brings points . &quot;
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season of the season , with the result also , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we must fit in au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple @-@ chain is also to be optimized further . &quot;
and one goal after a release does not want to catch up the progres@@ ses anymore .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the qu@@ ad chain than with the qu@@ ad chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act like us in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Wireless , but Hoffmann is sure of his job , &quot; because we &apos;re in the three @-@ cu@@ ff on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ ising and we do not afford so many playback errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , also Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak of a mis@@ leading start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can see four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; after six to eight playing days , I judge the start into the season , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Wireless , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the play of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although guests leave the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday , at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we will swe@@ ep it off , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one must hit from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as boss coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant .
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Age Review submitted
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration authority ( Migration short@@ com@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for mistakes in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rat@@ ec has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests dating from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the for@@ ensi@@ c medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be under 18 years of age .
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are stable during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases , which &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det submitted the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of the wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is incorrect . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete were installed on the bridge at the eastern end entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an in the department of road and traffic in the government pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is scheduled for October , and Lei@@ cht is certain that the schedule is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a steel arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other bridges , it has now come to the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.5 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning has received 1,@@ 3m wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called brid@@ ging cap on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; this is a border fastening , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge can be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is going to run .
&quot; the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger tip @-@ feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the main road in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher place entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge alloys is 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is hard to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ stag group ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance with a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ del invites to a poster &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , brings the top duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the deputy commander Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the African @-@ eag@@ les , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally , the town @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain site , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forums One World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , was really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; ur@@ ian potato salad , which could eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many officials from Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ dies reports that he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was in demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ k there are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does it : at 8 p.m. on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the audi@@ t@@ orium there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidates for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy commander Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can cut off - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli introduces in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ äle &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have a solo position in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into an intri@@ gu@@ ing artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is quite open about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally dealt bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , she ass@@ ures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I &apos;ve been in love with everyone I &apos;ve done . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I only liked it never to be taken seriously .
&quot; she suffered particularly among them according to &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but at school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some refer to me as being than@@ kl@@ ess , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; said Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told a big announcement at West Virginia Beach before .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country according to For@@ bes , was voted in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Govern@@ ors Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather hin@@ der us than working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , consistent message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chair of R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russian athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ap@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were str@@ apped out of gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to rep@@ or@@ ters . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lets from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for the armed soldiers in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the North @-@ Hessen Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
&quot; to the still un@@ explained crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she called the two &quot; &quot; reverse &quot; &quot; pilots as &quot; &quot; benef@@ actors &quot; &quot; of their profession . &quot;
&quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the families in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that the funeral service started in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German armed forces and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; gri@@ m @-@ branches laid down ro@@ ses , and the relatives stood arm in the arm of the s@@ war@@ ms . &quot;
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Ley@@ en lab@@ oured the rear soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and s@@ led . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flying operation of the fighter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , said , &quot; &quot; If this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts at the Mali Mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Ley@@ en : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this divided the König@@ shaus on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , it was further stated in the press release . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to be king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also laid down the title &quot; Prinz@@ horn . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the boss of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his native country , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik was vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk threads instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis rather than football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation here to be the brand of society critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for over@@ sight . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed .
this was just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens Members from their parliamentary election in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a difficult crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official election of the country elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its tight one @-@ voice majority in parliament against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the old Green Party members El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tional leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants his faction to take up her .
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new country day will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , believes it is essential that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament is depri@@ ved of confidence , and chooses a successor . &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities have to be checked illeg@@ ally , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace , if they are legally tested legally . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ ie &apos;s step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the dism@@ iss@@ al dep@@ u@@ ties to return their country meeting .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they have received their Land@@ tag@@ sm@@ and@@ at , which has received them on the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the president of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ westen very much . &quot;
they have deliberately decided not to speak a pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; also against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate and elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly re @-@ elect the Diet . &quot;
the exit of the West cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian is in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony does this dirty war game and tries to beat out political capital .
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD head of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ westen combined with personal career gifts the result of the 2013 country election . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD , the strongest force , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed parts , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal have happened ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the most up @-@ to @-@ date information about the eggs in question . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ n@@ aissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are bu@@ oy@@ ant and harmless .
&quot; if the resi@@ dues of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg are exceeded with eggs , they are not able to transport . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , production companies are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little controllers in the appointment . &quot;
is it only necessary for the personnel or the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences exist are of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made it clear , that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment from the responsible authorities . &quot;
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to exclusively obtain safe and market@@ able gro@@ c@@ eries .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect all the competent authorities , that the atomic fact is quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated . &quot;
how the financial rules of football have an impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ imp@@ eded European football clubs , will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the executive body that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G eventually has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can easily make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to interact with legitimate income sources , which enable them to make the break @-@ even point in their work on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election as the UEF@@ A Pres@@ idents in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , its UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be fri@@ ghtened by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; for sure , FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum @-@ up sum can be exp@@ elled for the next five years amoun@@ ting to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the hard@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normally 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial supervision by bl@@ ending their income through companies linked to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be reached via payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will be a World Cup Ambassador and could easily find out such maneu@@ vers for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive , consider every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga with a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial issue because one can go different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is standing before a possible end : the airline circul@@ ates the job .
&quot; on request of the News Agency , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two or three years and undergo quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate panels distribute 14 grams per year before landing on passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the cost .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the contract volume according to &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate producer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants bear in the new announcement , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a comment . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ ff@@ ing down at the core of the g@@ ags - actors of middle ages , g@@ ossi@@ p children who are grown up - they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the casting of the gun , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker &apos;s films of the 90 @-@ th anniversary like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that sw@@ ells the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character stum@@ bles through an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the grac@@ ious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in the Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the exc@@ esses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt Dill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ ard by &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments random mad@@ ness that could cause this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band &apos;s film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon meanwhile reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West ring @-@ combat icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director gives an intri@@ cate TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice ags to see ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a re@@ agent , is involved - that it often plays like a single one . &quot;
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was damaged on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef regularly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ ote a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday morning the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart searched numerous objects , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday . &quot;
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials ordered larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two people were arrested in Italy at the same time . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are presum@@ ably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were in operation . &quot;
&quot; the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organized drug crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug traff@@ icking in the South German region . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als mainly returned to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
ways complain big gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partially grave mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the foreigners &apos; register . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to partially grave mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations , in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; was present . &quot;
&quot; according to statistics , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 national authorities in Germany .
&quot; since the data wasn &apos;t maintained sufficiently , the quality of data in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 was found in individual cases , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics on visa @-@ based people , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to leave at all . &quot;
&quot; but such false assignments led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with visa @-@ based , &quot; so it is said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in paper , it is said that BA@@ MF leads such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper writes in reference to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin treaty , refugees from the EU state are responsible for achieving them first . &quot;
&quot; if a immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with less children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot;
Italy submitted guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) regards these commitments sufficient .
other EU states also would send refugees back thi@@ ther as part of the Dublin treaty .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights violations in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .
&quot; first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now , with his now 100 donations , shared 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the municipality appl@@ au@@ ds multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the Municipal Council . &quot;
&quot; it is ingen@@ ious how our body is prepared for it and we give respect to the don@@ ors , who provide their blood for strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preser@@ ves are divided into their components . &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , corn makers reported from the actions carried out in spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the Head of DR@@ K . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the transition to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Par@@ quet were among the multi@@ ples and have been awarded for 50 outstanding blood donations each . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter made ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members of interest in this month , as the weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that interest increases in the next few years would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the loan costs could possibly exceed more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks from the coming February , although it was said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continued to bear the consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , she repeated that &quot; a certain ti@@ ghtening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; scale than the markets are expecting . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell to these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of an increase of interest , and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight sal@@ aries , as the sharp@@ ening is getting worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; the in@@ comes policy in the next few years , but she added that wages will be re@@ covering at the end of her three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumer spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0,25 % last August after the shock@@ ing EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the breakdown . &quot;
&quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until it will reach the prices and the economy completely . &quot;
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July required an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the bank said that the exceeding proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decl@@ ining of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , since the credi@@ tors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive manner . &quot;
&quot; the market looks very good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closing , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10.000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a high court battle against the financing of the drug .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis received before the sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the Health Service through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he ple@@ dged to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first that will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in case of infections .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken any day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well @-@ known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program becomes £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical expos@@ ures as it is used , taken and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted targeted and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we hear@@ ti@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank manager with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day .
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ l@@ apping , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
&quot; fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the requirement . &quot;
&quot; the steel works are rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without having to leave . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance there are mir@@ r@@ ored units for all cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door very easily slide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the base size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that provide the space to its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square metre of some standard into something very astonishing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this one . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US Dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dy@@ nasty , in a debate about one of the largest real estate imperi@@ als Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club , and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis , lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
the family of West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; according to a court file , this means that Col@@ in owns the value of $ 316 million and Paul valued at 176 million dollars . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts .
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood properties in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , although Col@@ in claims that Mark has been paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; Paul &quot; said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in kept back very well although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
new Chief of Staff Tr@@ um@@ ps is planning to restrict the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that entered into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Can@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former electoral advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit , according to six former election officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady pra@@ ises . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets would have had more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his employees have managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has consistently prevented it from causing tr@@ ump contro@@ versy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons , to indu@@ ce question@@ able information . &quot;
this was an example of rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former g@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; &quot; be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot;
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced wrong accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the people will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe ship in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals fle@@ eing .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and wor@@ shipped . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; advent calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many refugees hide themselves from holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ende , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online mem@@ orials could have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them due to evidence following the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords in the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travelers at the foot of the war , which have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the community in order to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; passengers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s row . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ full group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious inhabitants have afflic@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my municipal taxes , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local resident , who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last lap of those travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many local people as possible to report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine , when we put our case forward . &quot;
aus Birk@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is built from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof due to the then Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at the time in the municipal council .
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald has defended the site of the hotel , and already spoke of serious interested parties to the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with manager Birgit Sch@@ erer together with registered office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the earlier Hotel Birk@@ enhof have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , blan@@ kets partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; very bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewel out of it . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to expand , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the external plants are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant that is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. special promot@@ er sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair for US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; referring to people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investigation and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; the station CN@@ N reported , there were already pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps äl@@ zer &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
US intelligence services have accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand in the election campaign as an advisor to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also recorded more and more tr@@ um@@ ps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the center and attempts to investigate whether the President may have disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases , and decide whether to be charged . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called count chambers .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
&quot; in addition , the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to charge persons for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath . &quot;
&quot; according to the CN@@ N station , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his son @-@ in @-@ law director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in conversation with him . &quot;
&quot; experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; however , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme of democr@@ ats gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he know nothing about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but these work also usually in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that ex@@ pedi@@ te the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not established against the President .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this alleg@@ ation , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he has disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Sonder@@ er@@ promot@@ er and his staff . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
&quot; unlike an independent promot@@ er of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
&quot; two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators on Thursday presented Bill &apos;s accus@@ ations , after which the special promot@@ er could not be dism@@ issed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tica , a gigantic ice @-@ mountain has become detached from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this granted the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tril@@ lion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large col@@ os@@ sus now travel north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that have registered researchers over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent the climate change has played a role in the break @-@ off of the ic@@ eberg , according to researchers , is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of s@@ nu@@ d@@ dly in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; in the north of this archipelago , the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs was disturbed years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete cow@@ ard is sm@@ ashed there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shr@@ ub is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece of a piece is cut off at a key point . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it produces after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the shade causes the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small measure , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest shr@@ ub of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks on a regular basis .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the polar sign now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers have not trac@@ ed the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , so in the past decades many s@@ nu@@ d@@ ls of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have collap@@ sed . &quot;
this long peak of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to the data of the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the increase in temperature has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , and t@@ aps into the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to hire Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls for ex@@ iting from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new offices in the administration went through . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in the circle are obviously very popular .
there were about 620 applications for the places that were in vain for this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the group lacks further personnel in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the parties &apos; desire , the administration should develop a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term demands on skilled workers , but to counter@@ act future @-@ orient@@ ated application scar@@ city , is to say . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself both internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for trans@@ verse clim@@ bers and include an education offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees will be able to reti@@ re from the service of illness or age . &quot;
the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was already anxious for a nice surprise on the day of the day , when he publicly challenged personnel costs and bl@@ oss@@ oms the rest of the parties . &quot;
&quot; nations want all possibilities to be reviewed , which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the circular cities - a home tari@@ ff , &quot; so nations . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ffs for the public service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money is available only if you switch to a higher level that ori@@ ents itself to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new constitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rix and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone to NGO &apos;s migrants &quot; rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had effectively worked with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to express itself in detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all alleg@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of &apos; Jugend ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew receives din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds , and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta do have to have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or ob@@ struc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize Win@@ ner Organization MS@@ F is without limits ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ i , meanwhile , said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , which resulted in efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started seeing light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and attractions for four days . &quot;
&quot; for this , three be@@ friend@@ ed guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always extended asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , look@@ out at the look@@ out point , connected through &quot; &quot; flo@@ wer@@ est &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed in the open air inhal@@ atorium healing Sole .
also Neustadt was controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4,@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - spor@@ tive and cul@@ turally . &quot;

&quot; this has also recognized the first Bundes@@ liga , which are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Dr. Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organiz@@ es the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke &amp; Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once per year to send the Federal Chancellor to Asia . &quot;
what is this exactly ?
&quot; in E @-@ Sport computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or even the FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , like in normal sports , they have established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it a real sport in general ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , Ingo F@@ rob@@ bing has dealt with the question . &quot;
&quot; for the professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sport - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction to responsi@@ veness need . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also to exercise their body and take care of the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
&quot; positively , the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; the players are internationally on the way , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts rapid growth ahead of e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to be at 130 million . &quot;
this is a little more than 2.4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers write . &quot;
international are already many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , there are some things . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ eke . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs according to Dut@@ t are meanwhile oblig@@ ated to set up an E @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; just to fall in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is not enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
you can &apos;t stick to it that only in football everything remains the way it was always .

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy push for suicide &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced to life by Conrad Roy in June , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free until his appointment .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward looking eyes when she was sentenced . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said it was a &quot; terrible fact that they completely regret .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; old or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day in which I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my sor@@ rows , which we shall bear for eternity , for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted by the realization &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to re@@ claim another , commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a car in 2014 .
&quot; the event attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , imagine yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter paid attention to Roy &apos;s death , and ordered that she would benefit from the case by any press . &quot;
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 due to murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup , is not a coinci@@ dence . &quot;
the FC Bayern won a great season with the Con@@ fed Cup winner - an extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; what was different in his seat in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ me immediately saw , even if the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , there was no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er to see , he made a rush to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner was behind , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also hint Kim@@ me .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a gam@@ bler in the C @-@ El@@ f established by youth players , de@@ posit@@ ors and just out of vacation , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot , which you want to keep in the mood . &quot;
&quot; those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ahm , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : assume responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ame fl@@ ashed across the field . &quot;
&quot; on the right side , this is his position , the white Bin@@ de in the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general , Kim@@ me worked in this starting formation as the one who can best take the helm in his hands . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , to get out of the performance of the Asia @-@ Travel ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le not neg@@ atively fall in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this all worked out very well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran along beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le tried a few times in the construction of the game . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy said that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we were hoping for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at the debut .
&quot; shift _ j@@ is ( Japanese , Win / Mac ) iso @-@ 2022 @-@ j@@ p ( Japanese , email ) &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bayern world is still for the new additions , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said good@@ bye to a few sh@@ aky statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have noticed now . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the New . &quot;

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics lo@@ dges Wis@@ mar Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is demonstrated by more than one year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ dle the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; bis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy which Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around is nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the list of priorities of the country .
&quot; this year the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 will be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western b@@ ypass of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Minister Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in this case , nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving for the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new master bonus , the Chamber of C@@ rafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young train@@ ee , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a prize of 1,000 euros is envis@@ aged for the completed master examination and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is fast facts , at the same time lacking the country the necessary staff , says Jan Bell , chief executive director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 positions are occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set mobility in the state business . &quot;
the I@@ HK requires more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; according to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country concept to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the present broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; former Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green faction left Lem@@ ke for April to become the President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of discre@@ pan@@ cies it has already cleared the field . &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW President said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described activities as rec@@ alled .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
&quot; however , the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for autom@@ akers to install equipment for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles , also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of bann@@ ing the powerful car firms and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system in order to b@@ ypass the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the benefit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los bu@@ ds and laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ on@@ ists , the bul@@ ly @-@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still stands and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message is &quot; &quot; Lau@@ ghter , &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked among other things as a drawer for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works daily for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , stu@@ ffed animals and watches , his dro@@ ll figures still find a lot of distribution worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema &apos;s wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ less . &quot;
Lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught , and because of the disease transmitted insects are decl@@ ining , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past years , which in the spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a little chic@@ ory , a micro@@ bial , the d@@ warf @-@ goat we@@ ars , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered are a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration out of the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the rep@@ or@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and ab@@ domin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while the bodies are frequent throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been in office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are the editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two rep@@ or@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smile face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ or@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a son@@ ar prosec@@ utor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ doctr@@ inated and although the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the province capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a few blocks far before his Red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a was one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ eums of drug royal who are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traff@@ ick@@ ers in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , is broken by the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; at first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cartridges in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez , following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ or@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard meeting without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever they lead . &quot;
he voluntarily gave him that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which you as a journalist will fall - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ? why did you not tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could flu@@ ke like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now ask her , &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they do best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret startup and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days previously became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the rep@@ or@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who designated the governor themselves as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the rep@@ or@@ ters entered the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has stain@@ ed on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
&quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping conducted . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a rep@@ orter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which almost all the century ruled all political planes . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of frau@@ dul@@ ent cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; previously we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ compatible society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ or@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks against journalists of police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to keep the mouth &quot; , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continue work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug traff@@ icking is scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became rep@@ orter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to mar@@ vel at once . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band riv@@ als and security forces near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot;
from the ed@@ ged station they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , keeping watch to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable h@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain labor@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report published in the journal &quot; Current Biology , &quot; described it as &quot; the kept arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs living in the middle of the region between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he was buried in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was lacking in the surrounding rock on the board , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ bs@@ . ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just fl@@ ashes a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the principal au@@ tor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , even though it is covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ bled a changing shell , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as an anti@@ sep@@ tic , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed him to better mix in his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the sh@@ ad@@ owing is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the survi@@ ving animals survi@@ ves . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ ble behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ eck to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative sc@@ aly skin , but also remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived for millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he was buried in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle up to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that rose from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ amped by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ sts still cover hol@@ lowed ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it gets . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , that carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re @-@ long st@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police , there were almost 30 vehicles between the junction places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , including trucks . &quot;
&quot; first of all , there is no information about the exact number of publishers . &quot;
&quot; it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , there was a round trip around ten kilometres . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ rep@@ orter reports , it also happened on the road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle @-@ smo@@ kers who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ted or cat@@ ches the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take up your seat and thereby de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available on many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said S &amp; D spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor .
&quot; however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : one needs a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; it is also necessary to buy the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ preci@@ ation appears . &quot;
the train attend@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and occupied the reserved seat Y .
&quot; if the train companion arrives at the ticket control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , work on , keep silence . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attend@@ ant , check in the DB Navigator . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr Marketing Management Board . &quot;
&quot; second advantage : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who travel often , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; often you have yourself , but in any case one of the fellow travelers will not find all the documents you need to de@@ preci@@ ate online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the ID card is missing , or otherwise a document you have to prove . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ats Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
they put their mobile phone back in order to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman claimed his rif@@ le and cried out , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled to her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder that we have used to and which we can typically call .
at that moment I felt Schüt@@ tel@@ frost .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the people &apos;s point of view who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that she had heard countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her along , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I was lucky enough to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience an ec@@ centric racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep away from it .
&quot; the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place in front of the police authority who became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner , who had lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film directors . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came into mind with Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document , or do you try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites , in a community prof@@ ited by their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other n@@ atives followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns execution . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; and we are fighting constantly on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman there is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news security cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway in a demonstration .
it describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels obliged to remember this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV viewers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
&quot; cold , the topic hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the supporters build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of construction work , it will be finished . &quot;
&quot; the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - with the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmer &apos;s market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is that too . &quot;
&quot; above all , the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall is in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping bou@@ quet in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive above price . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , store stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rented apartments are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special shops are almost no longer and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the farmers market hall go down during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit gallery actually comes . &quot;
or does it create the spec@@ tr@@ al bit gallery before selling all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ noticeable - hanging from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she made public diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and a pioneering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp even though some intellectual commentary is not just the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , who has spoken openly about identification as a woman , has been sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; their image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which it was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ umm@@ ers and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use have become un@@ equal bri@@ ers who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which President Chel@@ seas would transform judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition . &quot;
&quot; indeed , that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further fl@@ ames the rigid divisions that he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a exchange of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) show how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ icy Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own space , is a page from the Com@@ ic Nov@@ ell mentioned above . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , how it appears in hand from the disciplinary markets of the United States such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they col@@ t your speech , then they have won , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop your mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ utes from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ors that rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; , &quot; Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University
&quot; a country @-@ wide hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; a War@@ ning System , published by the Chicago police authority , states that the body was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still dead on the scene of the action , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them has now been vac@@ ated and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he appe@@ aled the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force themselves , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
security cameras confirmed that loading and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and investig@@ ates a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the code describing the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of dop@@ ing approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov reported problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;

&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction , &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
that shared the business groups .
&quot; it was purely a precau@@ tion , and it could no longer be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the press release . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have demonstr@@ ably been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ ru@@ ff@@ les . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up with your employees , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , specific groups and demographic groups , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which executives have low cons@@ ular results - so you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the nearest U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has posted a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial @-@ technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; converting has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; recently , u@@ ber has signed up as a client . &quot;
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , converting companies can send custom @-@ made &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ tible has deployed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the dis@@ comfort of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Conver@@ cent company uses , problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ - to be identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service and loads the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; in February , Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; at $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , he secured his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard , and that the work that you do is worth it , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ ted and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors gain Ren@@ di@@ ments when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third ple@@ dge to increase commitment and the use of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow your employees , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company gets more and more insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose your customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it &apos;s up to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ ge on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
&quot; players entering the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the Aqu@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood took practical exercises .
20 before the beginning of the formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the change in the N@@ CA@@ A , even if it adds another point to the many busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have simply pushed through , they are plac@@ ating on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will finish their practice as soon as the camp is finished , given the clear guidelines of his fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective network behind a door@@ post that will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brother players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room there and then adjust to an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video bit of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and display their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fac@@ tual checks , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded ahead of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they do not succeed in eliminating hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook explained in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fake audi@@ tors in third parties are challenged , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be testing his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a novel novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Main@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb printing on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; that is his thumb @-@ print !
&quot; and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old paper@@ work that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the site and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape care , gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent who had said : &quot; you might think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; Kni@@ ght@@ Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ rons , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l presented his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a g@@ aun@@ er , making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men sol@@ ves their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his involvement in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the territory of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature once more . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ achi chapel envel@@ oped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ achi chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Art@@ z . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their un@@ folded website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; in fact , we are firmly convinced that we as a Bad Honne@@ fer are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef lets its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan afraid of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on Pen@@ sion@@ ers and Promot@@ ions in the Offic@@ ers &apos; Corps . &quot;
this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five vice @-@ ministers as well as the Ministers of Defense , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in abundance . &quot;
the government draws the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dep@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired up 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ il Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , that Erdo@@ gan sees as a wi@@ re@@ drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; for 486 people who have been involved in the attempted coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the attempted coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really hold the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale guard at the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed further 73@@ 95 officials , including 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they expressed their role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ wart@@ ed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reforms of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is systematically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an officer , who searched for asylum from fear of persecution abroad , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance with the pur@@ ges there is doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries are spending green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for racing tyres
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months has been argu@@ ing about the future of the Hankook race . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , the tourist train is scheduled to be built on the mar@@ ode circuit . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Hankook race in the long term , construction works are expected to start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ction the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important link , &quot; said Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of the track was estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country sur@@ passes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , will be voted defini@@ tively , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Thuring@@ ian Railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; with this , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in recent months , in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested if the distance is used by many people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ y .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it could not be more crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of the sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we have to start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs &quot; and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; be in the mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female features , the all@@ usions to rape when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : resist@@ ent ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bs a most . &quot;
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most males will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ aks out of the marginal zone , in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , can be very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has promised to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn bodies and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they do not have a mediation or a background story , nothing that points to independence or anything , which might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to put it in the expression of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a hop@@ el@@ essness of the Tr@@ ump era , that political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ selecting relatives .
we are all supposed to blow up all of our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families to bring together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows them , including the repub@@ lican kin@@ ship , with whom she fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dist@@ ressing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer rep@@ el us . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more fri@@ ghtening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of guil@@ t@@ iness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the crazy - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ousel of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals turn around in order to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the city &apos;s reality will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Car@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , as here are two two @-@ year old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked them . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compens@@ ate the valuation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ essi@@ vely gr@@ ins@@ ing while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for hospit@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder based on a appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he was holding his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they were too cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ul@@ ls from F@@ aten and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eagle rising in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler im Hüh@@ ner@@ hof . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to breed from his chick@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken co@@ d a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope to make of him a chicken sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in studying Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ dd@@ les , who bore barrels to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , said school@@ mate Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every quad@@ rant that he felt in his new school .
&quot; it followed thanks to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps on teaching sen@@ g@@ asses , and the par@@ ental representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she would leave her pup@@ il only very rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ ul@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ class aqu@@ educ@@ ators have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal persons in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have ti@@ ghtened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emission characteristics of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the Schumacher software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the German Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet known an exact date . &quot;
Daimler announced to write every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its scope . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fitting take place overall ?

the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update last ?

ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center as the first r@@ apper .
&quot; this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the prize winner , which was announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would abst@@ ain from participating in the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and this burden me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear of her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement next year . &quot;
the job is already written - but suitable applicants are rare .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder . &quot;
and the work is still great fun to him as he medi@@ ates in the press line .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is a wonder that no application has fulfilled the requirements profile so far . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next time .
&quot; according to regular dism@@ iss@@ al dead@@ lines , it should be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub @-@ contractor , the applicant must prove corresponding degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer fill it , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but clos@@ eness to citizens is the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city viable , &quot; he is safe about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future various projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a site and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz is about to be initiated .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will beat around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; designed for a city builder , a large play area is available . &quot;
Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own farm and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexibly in many ways .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the creation of green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what it fits , &quot; when new builds are approved , the out@@ going city builder emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; &quot; in the end , everything is going on over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor will stay for a long time , W@@ acker wishes him : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , the city of Has@@ lach should have a completed course of studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree with discipline architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building and building planning law . &quot;
&quot; civil construction , civil engineering , mining activities , administration of urban properties , urban farm building with building yard and urban gardening as well as Unter@@ e Bau@@ haus authorities , including monument protection . &quot;
thrown by bike onto pi@@ pel@@ ines : Süd@@ bahn@@ stretch blocked
&quot; according to the police , the so far unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines . &quot;
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , a ros@@ ary roller and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ a st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ proof drive and the costs for rail transport vehicles , pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , from a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ rail route could be carried out without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger cars had failed on Friday morning , two of them watched the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains were not falling , but they delayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can ring for your digestive system as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food are not penet@@ rating into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet full of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han emp@@ ties , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also affects people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an investig@@ ates a kind of immune cell that stimul@@ ates tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accomod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA sequ@@ encing and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a sterile environment so they did not develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained by the reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; to understand how bacteria affect the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism that is known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control infections on the internal surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believing Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched to Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho insi@@ sted three more new commitments , but insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new low @-@ blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister immediately looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no camp@@ fire from the party centre , only no head@@ wind out of the Bund - was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus monitor the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot;
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition forces of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green cannot be reliably ruled out , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the surprising fraction of a Green Party , led by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , over@@ threw a heavy crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the non @-@ heart@@ ed Lower Saxony @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U implies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the German Managing Director and Elec@@ toral Committee of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD vot@@ er si@@ gh , when on Friday afternoon , the new message message reached the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without his own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional point of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state feder@@ ations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this was done - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the pl@@ unge , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; after that , comrades in the weeks were struggling again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next precip@@ itation came .
&quot; mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the Volkswagen exhaust system and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ esis surveys were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents in the league over the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not cover comra@@ de in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from af@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and especially on the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ westen there . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen represents their own career interests on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to the Parliament on the national list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , as well as the Lower Saxony MEP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate , four years ago , was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career path of a future CD@@ U member counter@@ fei@@ ts the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there was more or had further commitments made by the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
grants for town@@ spe@@ ople III
&quot; who wants to san@@ ction his house in the years , will soon be able to get support from the country . &quot;
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG city development on Wednesday felt sensi@@ tively .
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened before . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been a lot of rehabilitation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renovation projects are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to also promote the interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a restructuring area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are coming from the country , the rest of the congregation . &quot;
how does a restructuring area arise ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is interest to renov@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area limits may also be moved again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EG contracts on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
&quot; finally , the restructuring area would eventually be set as a stat@@ ute . &quot;
the promotion period for the funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the survey would only take place once again , within the scope of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill in a questionn@@ aire for filling . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , it should be possible to take the order as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can be started next year . &quot;
&quot; later , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the predicted pre @-@ investigations . &quot;
it is about evaluating and deciding the urban gri@@ ev@@ ances when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective property , there will also be a certification mem@@ or@@ and@@ um in the basic book . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to feelings and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it is , among other things , about the structural condition and the renovation plans . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; &quot; data on size , distribution and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; rain@@ bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when used in the building business premises . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to note that a filled questionn@@ aire does not apply at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of the funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - those who first come first ex@@ h@@ ort .
you cannot reserve tickets for later . &quot;
&quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a manual movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s specifications that were left to TIME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence , and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued by a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Chron@@ icle of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his super@@ visor , the assistant naval commander of aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the plane during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation when the presidential plane was in front of the backdrop of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn , in order to dism@@ iss the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs of the crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicop@@ ters flew an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget desig@@ nations for the presidential , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
record of Un@@ ity record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered the event with the South La@@ wn , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ out with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky task
the top @-@ end of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga takes place at the table @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC @-@ Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel on the table @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite after five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable record , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent in any case .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , the imports from the far north are concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets on the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser squ@@ ad for the trip to the high north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment when the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec is one of his first efforts in this season . &quot;
&quot; the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo , yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball . &quot;
&quot; he should also be the same as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World rank@@ ings in January 2016 . &quot;
how America can harm OM@@ V
&quot; real lucky , Donald Tr@@ ump did not appear when he put his signature under the law for ti@@ ghtening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to issue the law , Congress packed a few &quot; constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming the US off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the local OM@@ V have been involved in the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Region Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; has viewed which the Group could aver@@ t and which could really hurt him .
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts in the Net@@ fli@@ x charts . &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer revealed , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not far ahead . &quot;
&quot; the squ@@ ads three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ ghts of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more governmental bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) warran@@ ts the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;

roll backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the urban day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ governing . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task , and supplies fresh water @-@ cooked . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 hours of the week are cared for , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ino . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service starting September 1st : they heat the incoming food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the size - there are two @-@ group , as well as seven @-@ scale installations - decides on the range of hours . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ ebo@@ arding to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot;
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is meaning@@ fully .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the function of the kitchen forces - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , has also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , it is from the Press Office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours don &apos;t fall into the weight of some 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , senior leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the provinces in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban launched threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ om said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

two young men at the age of 19 and 23 years should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police information , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 am , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
&quot; then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the phone and the N@@ eckl@@ ace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;

the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to certi@@ fy the long @-@ term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which includes other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea Cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie asks for &quot; &quot; express concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we are unable to gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Grand Area of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is desper@@ ately a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the GM at T@@ oll@@ cross yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to stay competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not ref@@ rain from having an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ sman in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world been warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ ot@@ ers dropped and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown off@@ ender has deliberately turned off one in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 , and so on the facing of the car damage of more than 200 Euro . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for instructions . &quot;
the police witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car met him on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the lead plan . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 19.@@ 55 . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his lane , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver touched the guiding plan . &quot;
in the car there was no damage .
&quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the perpetr@@ ator , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen account for the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ person for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ated Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret about their own om@@ issions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence against Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in terms of the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that must be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ ar@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ ar@@ ia . &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a bound fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; in total 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of assault , 67 dome @-@ scr@@ ape sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be noted that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases of physical and mental violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , despite violence , even had positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Ez@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion is reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence of violence at shel@@ ters at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more tangible for the Ö@@ f@@ ter , if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger seems to be in it at all . &quot;
&quot; he has just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; it is necessary to submit to it at best , to experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ eck gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also exhibits a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and high emotion@@ ality , which led to wounds . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he was not only scar@@ ed with chairs and threw the key on the ground , but also distributed ears and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of whether or not it is more with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood Him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a sad@@ der for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is however that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do you assess the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Stu@@ dents R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was calculated ... bu@@ ds inv@@ ader or clearer or even more opened than vis @-@ à @-@ vis their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust@@ ees etc . &quot;
that you talk with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to talk of any complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these war@@ y crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; was to be read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former master kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; Look &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; in fact , there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers have been hur@@ led and mur@@ der@@ ated , all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims under@@ estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence , even have positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at the most , the repro@@ ach remains to be looked at . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the Prim@@ ary School . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then only in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger systematically swal@@ low the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gymn@@ asi@@ um , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; that the pre @-@ school will continue to practice the pun@@ ishments . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when exam@@ in@@ ers were banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal gray area , like everyone else knows . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away . &quot;
this is just right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the imprisonment of schools in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was horrible at all times and also not for what was verb@@ alised in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s se@@ elen , which goes far beyond the then usual . &quot;
&quot; this is all aw@@ ful , and I am happy that it will finally be worked out . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is , to draw the ear , and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which image of his Regensburg time has changed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject also translate to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not deny that he led a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ sp@@ ells , true culture amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , you don &apos;t even make a great singer and stand before every success , right in whatever field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I really became acquainted with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , primitive , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I receive regular contact with him , like many former cats today , 23 years after his embar@@ k@@ ation , regular contact with him , visiting him - he is almost blind - and treated him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ spar@@ ks are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ respect for which she is still looking at today and which she is almost rever@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report that has just been published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the rise would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
