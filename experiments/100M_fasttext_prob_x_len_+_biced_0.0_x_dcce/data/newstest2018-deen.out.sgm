<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car-Navi took on a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria in the state government, are anything but current - but precisely therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a rag rug that you don't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large map shows more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called Urpositional Sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerischer surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since spring 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria into order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove forward the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Comparative Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional Sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the former / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map, i.e. 1877, in the district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the today Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasants" uprising against Austria in 1705. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the west park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming, a small piece card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered hallmarks from the so-called" "primordial" "from which the land was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are little plots there today no more farmers - but small farmers of the plant" "Land in Sonne". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urpositional Sheet one reads in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen not only the street names" "at the Gasteig" "or at the top" "On the air" "- but also in big letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße there were once people locked up with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüfte". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who dealt with the institution for an exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, first place had been place, later on 500 places were expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the chalk pension in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest atriums."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth shelter with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected - in architectural references to the origins of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War with bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" main place, "the Kaufingerstrasse was named" Kaufinger alley. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombings seized many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a mining chapel from the Middle Ages were once again at the Marienhof where this day was the preliminary work and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk road on 5 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider bar, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to Promote Farran has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently been found throughout the state and noted here," said the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted Bill of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination complaining, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state who are disproportionately to minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights which happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Atsouri Attorney General Office, showing that black motoring in the state is 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring them with interest or let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri signed 100 Hassan Breaks, according to the latest figures from the FBI report programme of the FBI that classify the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states have adopted immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violation, which will contribute to further racial profiling in view of the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher pasture fence project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have presented themselves on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the recess courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates in five apartments Feriengirth."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest milk "is for him the alternative commercialization path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday-guests only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV-president of Fischerbach, he called the fence project as" "fundamental". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green area care for a lot of work, much needed to be machined with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and with the topography to fight," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he did not lead a bio farm."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they carry out their operations," "said Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs amounting to EUR 71 500 were promoted, a quarter contributed to the community of fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, farmers stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and housewives it is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state-of-the-art sponsorship of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of a sponsorship designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fenced area must not be tradesiable (slope incline above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisherbacher Weighing project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parking spaces, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open-hold area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump régime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the presidency's proposals for drastic immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he touched on their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after finishing the monument, has been added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem to which you refer to will be added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your idleness, your poor, and your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, the ending waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "moving waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">"this conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America."</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had done a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism, portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical form."</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus also changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly like Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this long ago."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one, but rather an early neoconservatives that bring the American flame into the readied world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of men seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black knocks Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship cadres will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special develops" "and the UK's athletics has to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally occured was great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with her fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-distance runner Muir carries on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman for the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that she is" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in the medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on Podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out and compete there, and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block Kritikern via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the natives of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shouted in the critique, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics silenced.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said," "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union promised him this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hoof-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilfully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the governor's side - is a public forum, which is designated officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hasserole people who vibrate on the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans of Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for Hassan."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's employees called as" concentrated spam "attack, others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or deleting a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest demonstrators and silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she appointed a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters of paper hit his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that settled Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticized his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The saving and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters Tumlingens to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the" "Vogtei" "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"the wording of the document was on the Tumbler mountain apart from the former parish church, in addition to the former parish church, also a magnificent courtyard which belonged to the church or the patron and not reversed."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the local picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "the third, the splendid settlement core of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage was originated from the early medieval Own Right.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"with this, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two pieces on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang in 1692 for the first time, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were carved and the bells were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops encamped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church was aborted.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was aborted."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today remained a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant from the" "Schaffhausen Rentner" "as the successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organisers, friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Freudenstadt Kepler-Gymnasium and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">"for the serenade of the Serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view of meadows to the forest," the organizers discover the fantastic views. "</seg>

<seg id="504">Association seeks to verify permission from wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim refuses" "does not see any legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the councilor."</seg>
<seg id="506">"Boisheim," Boisheim, "has requested Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are supposed to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, but the district government in Düsseldorf was not approved because of a defect."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planned legal requirements, the informed approval envy is still unlawful and therefore also to decline," said Christoph Erkens, President of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permission of the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "in this point, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally impossible."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Viersen since last week," "explained a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to reconsider the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the process to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argumentation of the" Boisheim "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - equivalent to roughly one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four-size households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district."</seg>

<seg id="863">"these were two counterparts too much, and we must fit in aue even better," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>

<seg id="865">And one goal after a release does not want to catch up the progresses anymore.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the quad chain than with the quad chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how to act like us in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Wireless, but Hoffmann is sure of his job, "because we're in the three-cuff on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießmann players who can build up well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are still better harmonising and we do not afford so many playback errors."</seg>

<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they couldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know that 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the interior defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"although guests leave the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday, at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we will sweep it off, just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive with only a defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="887">"until today, Migratec has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests dating from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the forensic medicine Agency judged that the person was" possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion that the person may be under 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson, the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are stable during the past months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to the journal The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">"the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years, does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age."</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases, which" suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules, which aim to prevent unimpeded European football clubs, will not bother Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the executive body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, which were launched by the UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG eventually has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can easily make the money loose, so that Neymar underwrites and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to interact with legitimate income sources, which enable them to make the break-even point in their work on the football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after his election as the UEFA Presidents in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015, its UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be frightened by excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"for sure, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum-up sum can be expelled for the next five years amounting to EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the hardest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normally 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to oversee their financial supervision by blending their income through companies linked to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could be reached via payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will be a World Cup Ambassador and could easily find out such maneuvers for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive, consider every attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>

<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced chocolate for Swiss.</seg>

<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when they retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members of interest in this month, as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalized that interest increases in the next few years would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by Brexit, and she said that the loan costs could possibly exceed more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>

<seg id="1283">"the decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0,25% last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the breakdown."</seg>
<seg id="1284">"the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years, until it will reach the prices and the economy completely."</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates increased because inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers in July required an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a high court battle against the financing of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pretext prophylaxis received before the sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the Health Service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he pledged to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention" "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first that will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in the whole of England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in case of infections.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken any day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"suitable participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well-known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt-in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program becomes £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical exposures as it is used, taken and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of mankind. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted targeted and vulnerable people, offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We heartily welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now as the prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health Minister, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV, and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bank manager with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overlapping, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"fan had to think creatively, in order to solve the requirement."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to leave."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height, with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so that when you push the door very easily slide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the base size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide the space to its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square metre of some standard into something very astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide to leave this one."</seg>

<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton-Football Club, and developer Colin De Lutis, lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family in 1973 bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">The family of Westco jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul described as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">"according to a court file, this means that Colin owns the value of $316 million and Paul valued at 176 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed attempts.</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used security to buy the Collingwood properties in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, although Colin claims that Mark has been paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were," Paul "said about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin kept back very well although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"Colin answered by SMS to say" I really can't say much, "because the case is in front of the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname by the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution. "</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that entered into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diets."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Candidat Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former electoral advisor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit, according to six former election officials, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady praises. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have had more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees have managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it from causing trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president for strategic reasons, to induce questionable information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former gump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh to" "be the source behind a heap of leaks" "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced wrong accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and document the trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still seek influence."</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is built from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the then Ambiente operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald has defended the site of the hotel, and already spoke of serious interested parties to the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with manager Birgit Scherer together with registered office in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1464">"rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to expand, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: U.S. special promoter sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair for US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury for a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the panel has taken up the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "referring to people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended his investigation and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the station CNN reported, there were already pre-invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps älzer's oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">US intelligence services have accused the Kremlin for a long time to purposefully intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand in the election campaign as an advisor to the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also recorded more and more trumps of private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special promoter Trump has personally moved to the center and attempts to investigate whether the President may have disabled the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Juries is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases, and decide whether to be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">"in addition, the committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to charge persons for interrogation under oath."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN station, pre-invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his son-in-law director Paul Manafort were in conversation with him."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"however, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme of democrats gives the Democrats an opportunity to" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement, he know nothing about setting up a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but these work also usually in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures that expedite the work of the special agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not established against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this allegation, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has disabled the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the Sondererpromoter and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent promoter of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the margins of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday presented Bill's accusations, after which the special promoter could not be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctica, a gigantic ice-mountain has become detached from the almost seven-fold size of Berlin by the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This granted the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometres large colossus now travel north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that have registered researchers over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent the climate change has played a role in the break-off of the iceberg, according to researchers, is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual interruptions of snuddly in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"in the north of this archipelago, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete coward is smashed there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shrub is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece of a piece is cut off at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it produces after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shade causes the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small measure, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest shrub of Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the polar sign now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers have not traced the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, so in the past decades many snudls of the Antarctic peninsula have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long peak of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"as a result, the increase in temperature has contributed."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years, and taps into the areas where the temperature is fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate itself both internally and externally, show concrete measures for transverse climbers and include an education offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has been in operation only for one year, refused to express itself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "said the organization in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge all allegations that are currently collected, only after we have collected all the information and judge the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Jugend rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that his crew receives dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds, and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa do have to have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or obstructions "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Winner Organization MSF is without limits (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minni, meanwhile, said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, which resulted in efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and co-operation with local mayors."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berlin Outpost "and two drivers met in Wachenheim in the North-Palatinate to enjoy Trials and attractions for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">"for this, three befriended guides were available."</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always extended ascents for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, lookout at the lookout point, connected through" "flowerest" "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled in the open air inhalatorium healing Sole.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sportive and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips for E-Sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the Sport-Stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of being sweating through wind and weather across the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this has also recognized the first Bundesliga, which are increasingly involved in this area."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says Dr. Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is certain," that there are still some clubs on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first" "Interactive Club World Cup" "in which the gamers of various clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke & Wolfsburg, for example Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds, that young people still go into the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once per year to send the Federal Chancellor to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is this exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in E-Sport computer games such as League Of Legends," Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or even the FIFA-simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"long ago, like in normal sports, they have established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and with the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport in general?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">"for a long time, Ingo Frobbing has dealt with the question."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sport - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction to responsiveness need."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also to exercise their body and take care of the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte player is a good player." ""</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Frobbing also sees problems:" doping is becoming more and more an issue. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"positively, the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of E-Sports."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"the players are internationally on the way, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth ahead of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to be at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is a little more than 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisers write. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are already many countries already.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football league clubs according to Dutt are meanwhile obligated to set up an E-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB-Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"just to fall in nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is not enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," "says Dutt."</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced to life by Conrad Roy in June, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter allowed to stay free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward looking eyes when she was sentenced."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any regrets." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters Attorney said it was a "terrible fact that they completely regret.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their" old or ripeness or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions. "</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that" there is no day in which I don't feel the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything. I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my sorrows, which we shall bear for eternity, for his sisters."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was" "persecuted by the realization" "that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain I will keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to reclaim another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the event attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hanging on, spring from a building, imagine yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the eyes of his suicide, she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "Everything you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1685">"judge Moniz said that Carter paid attention to Roy's death, and ordered that she would benefit from the case by any press."</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"one of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 due to murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison. "</seg>

<seg id="1690">"that Joshua Kimme was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup, is not a coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern won a great season with the Confed Cup winner - an extra motivation doesn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"what was different in his seat in the cabin, that Joshua Kimme immediately saw, even if the extra piece of clothing was very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, there was no Philipp Lame and no Manuel Neuer to see, he made a rush to his arm."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach has not announced it," "the Confed Cup winner was behind, after his first use as Bavaria-Captain."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the one could have run better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the coach could also hint Kimme.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight year older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a gambler in the C-Elf established by youth players, depositors and just out of vacation, but he."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot, which you want to keep in the mood."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"those who have been chosen to take the heritage of Lahm, can only use a small extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimme confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: assume responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old as a mini-lame flashed across the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"on the right side, this is his position, the white Binde in the arm did the rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and in general, Kimme worked in this starting formation as the one who can best take the helm in his hands."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the uncoordinated troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had the view of the whole, while many others were occupied with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus to overplay his missing fitness (foldable hardly); Renato Sanches therefore, to get out of the performance of the Asia-Travel (foldable also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not negatively fall in their first appearance in the Bavaria-Trikot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">This all worked out very well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran along beside Kimme, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle tried a few times in the construction of the game."</seg>
<seg id="1710">"his colleague Rudy said that" "the result" "was not as we were hoping for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a good performance at the debut.</seg>

<seg id="1713">"as usual, this Bayern world is still for the new additions, one saw in connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, Rudy did not have one or two interviews in the catacombs, but for six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimme said goodbye to a few shaky statements in the back of his new players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard from Süle an interesting sentence:" "what is going on here, I have noticed now."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"in Bavaria, you just have to win any game."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is demonstrated by more than one year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time taddle the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says:" "bissing attacks the desires of the economy which Lemke has blocked all."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The largest turnaround is natus in the infrastructure policy: the gap between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the list of priorities of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year the ministry hopes for a planning process, until 2021 will be right."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the western bypass of Trier, which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Minister of Minister Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"in this case, natus sees a signpost to support regional, but internationally competing companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier is striving for the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate, to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">"the planned road construction is fast facts, at the same time lacking the country the necessary staff, says Jan Bell, chief executive director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"up to now, only 29 positions are occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set mobility in the state business."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The IHK requires more orders to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">"according to the calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a country concept to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"furthermore, the present broadband expansion in the country is sobering."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described activities as recalled.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"however, the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the costs for automakers to install equipment for neutralizing the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles, also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive."</seg>

<seg id="1759">"the companies attempt to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back to normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several employees were charged by Volkswagen, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past years, which in the spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn.

<seg id="1800">"there is also a little chicory, a microbial, the dwarf-goat wears, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominals."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while the bodies are frequent throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been in office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are the editors and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smile face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a sonar prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are indoctrinated and although the terrain is still more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we all mistrust."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a few blocks far before his Red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "Twelfth River". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa was one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums of drug royal who are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traffickers in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken by the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"at first, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartridges in war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not force Valdez, following the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug dowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard meeting without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue to live," he said at the time of CPJ. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which you as a journalist will fall - either that or you play the dummy."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead? why did you not tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could fluke like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now ask her," "Is his love for routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they do best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret startup and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days previously became known that Spyware, which is sold solely to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who designated the governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has stained on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending concentrated on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping conducted."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which almost all the century ruled all political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors have been accused of fraudulent cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military assault."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" SOS Press "on sidewalks and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an incompatible society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks against journalists of police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die because they want you to keep the mouth", "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain back and continue work, it is a daily dance with risk-rich decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is scared."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to marvel at once."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the bathing resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"the war escalated, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region."</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the edged station they released the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers, keeping watch to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about closing," "said Bojorquez," "when the same day Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used cloaking to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable hashorns of a Canadian mountain laborer have been preserved so well that experts described it as" "Mona Lisa der Dinosaurs". ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report published in the journal" Current Biology, "described it as" the kept armoured dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs living in the middle of the region between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well preserved state has astonished researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk as he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was lacking in the surrounding rock on the board, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 lbs. (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just flashes a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that it has slept," said the principal autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this herbivores, even though it is covered with an armor and resembled a changing shell, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as an antiseptic, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed him to better mix in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shady, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the shadowing is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far the surviving animals survives."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure through meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals who use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnible behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have to have been the chalk time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life, including his conserved Darmineck to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservative scaly skin, but also remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk as he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle up to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tops that rose from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swamped by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater coverage of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautrests still cover hollowed armored plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it gets."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, that carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening at A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous wounded, kilometre-long staus and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the highway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"after the first data of the police, there were almost 30 vehicles between the junction places Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, including trucks."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"first of all, there is no information about the exact number of publishers."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it was light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of Munich, there was a round trip around ten kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as a AZ reporter reports, it also happened on the road to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle-smokers who now have to reckon with delicate penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment almost everyone has experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes an unsanted or catches the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take up your seat and thereby devaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test run runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year," said S & D spokesperson. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the train the ticket devaluation without a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"however, some requirements need to be fulfilled: one needs a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to buy the railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like this: one climbs into the train, calls his ticket to" My tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the test customers, a button for electronic depreciation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and occupied the reserved seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train companion arrives at the ticket control in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so one can continue to sleep, work on, keep silence."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, check in the DB Navigator."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, DB Fernverkehr Marketing Management Board. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second advantage:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who travel often, know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest cuffs."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"often you have yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers will not find all the documents you need to depreciate online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the ID card is missing, or otherwise a document you have to prove."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies only to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same track are not yet unlocked.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the road," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., killed live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "Ferrell thought."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">They put their mobile phone back in order to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying out and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who wore a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed at which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video she said, another policeman claimed his rifle and cried out," "I will kill you... animals all kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell recalled to her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder that we have used to and which we can typically call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt Schüttelfrost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the people's point of view who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a suitable crown, drove to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that she had heard countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black condition. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her along," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I was lucky enough to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience an eccentric racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at South Florissant Road, a place in front of the police authority who became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner, who had lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came into mind with Ferrell:" do you want to document, or do you try to find a story that you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites, in a community profited by their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives followed the team of Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns execution. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferris's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">Ferris's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "said Ferrell," "and we are fighting constantly on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "at which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman there is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news security cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she clings to a singing and she feels obliged to remember this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV viewers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery say:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the supporters build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of construction work, it will be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - with the Beda-Platz, with the possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmer's market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is that too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct marketing in a market hall is in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "why shopping bouquet in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive above price."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, store stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the rented apartments are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special shops are almost no longer and that which is still left will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the farmers market hall go down during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution, even if the bit gallery actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the spectral bit gallery before selling all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that stands empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg have no place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeable - hanging from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she made public diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp even though some intellectual commentary is not just the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, who has spoken openly about identification as a woman, has been sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"their image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stummers and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her incarcerated muse have become unequal briers who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" Suppressed Images "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelseas would transform judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"indeed, that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further flames the rigid divisions that he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the" automatic fragmentation, based on sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, mitochondrial DNA sequence - a exchange of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist) show how amazingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spicy Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the Comic Novell mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, how it appears in hand from the disciplinary markets of the United States such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they colt your speech, then they have won," it says. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop your mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who salutes from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacors that rally like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also goal-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5", "Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of doping approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports."</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood took practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a novel novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Mainl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says melancholy. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014" Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, "a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb printing on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that is his thumb-print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell like smoke, because at that time they lit a fire because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself was there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old paperwork that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") all this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape care, gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey and started writing. ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it onto the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had said:" you might think that country conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all his way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled" "KnightFamilies of Kent and Sussex", "Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the history of the Jesuit patrons, which the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell presented his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be quite a gauner, making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford. "</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solves their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landwithin."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his involvement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the territory of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature once more."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exil Preacher Fethullah Gülen, that Erdogan sees as a wiredrawing of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"for 486 people who have been involved in the attempted coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempted coup attempt as a" gift of God, "as he gave him the opportunity to completely cleanse the Armed Forces."</seg>

<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Unease in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>

<seg id="2354">"in any case, the large-scale guard at the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan decreed further 7395 officials, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered to be the masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they expressed their role as a guardian of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan thwarted the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reforms of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not be more crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of the sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs "and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed figures such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can" "be in the mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female features, the allusions to rape when one goes a step on Frigid (here: resistent) Farrah, disturbs a most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?"</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most males will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaks out of the marginal zone, in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, can be very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has promised to have sexually assaulted women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the worn bodies and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they do not have a mediation or a background story, nothing that points to independence or anything, which might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the expression of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a hopelessness of the Trump era, that political divisions, which have polarized the US voters, have also split families in small format."</seg>

<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to blow up all of our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed is the power of Trumps, families to bring together."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House anyone who knows them, including the republican kinship, with whom she fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"for the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the distressing effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalisation" "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his bibs will no longer repel us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing" normalized "which suddenly appear as the epitome of guiltiness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself surrounded by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the crazy - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild offence."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousel of the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine."</seg>

<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are supposed to improve the emission characteristics of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">"no, the software updates negotiated are voluntary."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Daimler announced to write every person affected.</seg>

<seg id="2506">How long will the retrofitting take place overall?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," Smetanin writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2508">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long will the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes into retirement next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written - but suitable applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun to him as he mediates in the press line.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is a wonder that no application has fulfilled the requirements profile so far."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"according to regular dismissal deadlines, it should be enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as a sub-contractor, the applicant must prove corresponding degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they could no longer fill it, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but closeness to citizens is the city and it is important to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have gathered, looking back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city viable," he is safe about the Bauamt and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future various projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla site and the Niederhofen parkplatz is about to be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will beat around 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "says Wacker."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"designed for a city builder, a large play area is available."</seg>
<seg id="2555">Haslachs own farm and gardener can be reacted flexibly in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the creation of green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what it fits, "when new builds are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasises."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister carries a high level of responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a client," "in the end, everything is going on over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor will stay for a long time, Wacker wishes him:" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further development of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you want to bury Roland Wacker, the city of Haslach should have a completed course of studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree with discipline architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building and building planning law."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"civil construction, civil engineering, mining activities, administration of urban properties, urban farm building with building yard and urban gardening as well as Untere Bauhaus authorities, including monument protection."</seg>

<seg id="2567">These were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, a rosary roller and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lusatia streich," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch on the APA. "</seg>

<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay-proof drive and the costs for rail transport vehicles, patrons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, from a" substantial "sum, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south-rail route could be carried out without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten passenger cars had failed on Friday morning, two of them watched the long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains were not falling, but they delayed."</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB-spokesman Christoph Posch about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can ring for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food are not penetrating into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet full of tryptophan empties, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also affects people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigates a kind of immune cell that stimulates tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was accomodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice were sequenced in DNA sequencing and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they did not develop an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained by the reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism that is known as idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastro-intestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control infections on the internal surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2607">"however, Matic was excluded from the pre-preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season."</seg>

<seg id="2609">We will help him sooner than later.</seg>

<seg id="2632">"the surprising fraction of a Green Party, led by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), overthrew a heavy crisis."</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the non-hearted Lower Saxony-member Elke Twesten to return their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU implies a clear falsification of the electorate's will.</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that raises American manufacturing last month, costs taxpayers according to the military's specifications that were left to TIME Magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued by a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the Chronicle of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his supervisor, the assistant naval commander of aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter hit the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the plane during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commandant."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are closed," the deputy commander answered. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are required to use them for the journey.</seg>

<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted on the training needs of the crew for the month, said an official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopters flew an additional 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in setting helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget designations for the presidential, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>

<seg id="2745">Record of Unity record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the funds for DoD do not include personnel costs, but consider the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present this week things that are made in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared by the former Regensburger bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeriated Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect evaluation of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that reporting on violence against Domspatzen is measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in terms of the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is" shameful and shameful deeds "that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scararia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scararia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and this is a bound fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "blows a very normal pedagogical means" "had been" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on misuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the" "My Brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"in total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of assault, 67 dome-scrape sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be noted that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases of physical and mental violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, despite violence, even had positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Ezemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion is relieved."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence of violence at shelters at the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who became more tangible for the Öfter, if a Domspatz has musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger seems to be in it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he has just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is necessary to submit to it at best, to experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspeck gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally -" Redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exhibits a very excellent testimony," "sincerely", "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always moved from grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which led to wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he was not only scared with chairs and threw the key on the ground, but also distributed ears and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, this is certainly Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is a question of whether or not it is more with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood Him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk with my father or mother about it," "said a sadder for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is however that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you assess the Domspatzen Students Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it was calculated... buds invader or clearer or even more opened than vis-à-vis their parents, dormitory managers, trustees etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report concludes with a clear result:" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to talk of any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these wary crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "violence" "was to be read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former master kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "Look" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers have been hurled and murderated, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, as most witnesses stress, the subject of" "Vorschule" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the secondary school gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims underestimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even have positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, the reproach remains to be looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the Primary School."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (as the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then only in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger systematically swallow the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," that the pre-school will continue to practice the punishments. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when examiners were banned in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, like everyone else knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult to estimate for him, where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the imprisonment of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" Fallstrick of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times and also not for what was verbalised in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children's seelen, which goes far beyond the then usual."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all awful, and I am happy that it will finally be worked out."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, that is, to draw the ear, and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which image of his Regensburg time has changed Georg Ratzinger for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject also translate to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the Domspatzen only played a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not deny that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world transpells, true culture ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, you don't even make a great singer and stand before every success, right in whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond, I really became acquainted with Georg Ratzinger and again and again as wonderful, humorous, primitive, deeply believing and heartfelt people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only do something in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I receive regular contact with him, like many former cats today, 23 years after his embarkation, regular contact with him, visiting him - he is almost blind - and treated him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him until today, that he was strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparks are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable disrespect for which she is still looking at today and which she is almost revered."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that you reproach him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report that has just been published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the rise would be a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
