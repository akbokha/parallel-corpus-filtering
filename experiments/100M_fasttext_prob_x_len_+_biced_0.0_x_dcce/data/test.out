28 @-@ year old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 year old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investig@@ ators are going to work .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; shocked &quot; &quot; on the ground over his death . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine anyone , who would harm his younger brother . &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; to connect his way with his family was to bring us something to cook , prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lighted bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has the information in this case will be asked to call the letter @-@ phone of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always need to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview now un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glu@@ ed from outside labels , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather snow@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; cosm@@ opol@@ itan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress pre@@ fers to spend their time at home , front TV with a loose Dut@@ t and mex@@ ican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the haw@@ k she brings the question of the desire for the children : &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is regarded as an all@@ ein@@ ous mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs on us starting August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration , they pursued home to the for@@ age trou@@ ghs in fast gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and then the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
&quot; he was led by his family over the anlage of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes . &quot;
long was the first time in Aachen and thus with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance handed the man out of An@@ hausen within the framework of a small gala the Golden sport pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
a long one is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has fo@@ stered the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the double US champion @-@ winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the winners are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the f@@ itter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping leader Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports le@@ es came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went into the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates , however , are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
about the role of the state .
&quot; in the case of doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep it small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax@@ ing the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will drive back on massive regulation , and he stands for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , says them . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost word@@ less . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump we could still send party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ use coal mining in the US .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , it wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and challenge renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; one country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time both the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but rather protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , calls for Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger @-@ wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens , stands to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the sector manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised shel@@ ters for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs initiated the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Assi@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors either .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hop@@ el@@ essness , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced @-@ compul@@ sion , hon@@ oral mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is no rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they are in Germany , ir@@ re , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that approximately 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich North are traum@@ ati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; because they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations only for them , asking B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for accommod@@ ating refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is such a thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are in some community @-@ canc@@ eled floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing , or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; first of all , the wash@@ rooms should be separate and accessible to women easily , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much as the women feel this need of protection , one can read the urge which it gives to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have been talking about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance doctors strike : demands for new work combat measures
the assistant &apos;s dep@@ u@@ ties have called up their union to appro@@ ve new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour combat measures beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the refusal of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; &quot; to problems , which resulted in the agreement being rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Executive Committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begin in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistants of this year dispute , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of B@@ MA &apos;s assistant doctors , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election for rej@@ ecting the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny myself that Ankara is most willing to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed st@@ ew , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , said repeatedly by his &quot; loving friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved like that would never happen . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin eman@@ ating , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ pour of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was rag@@ ing .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia .
&quot; the going was even bigger , as it was done by a supposed friend . &quot;
re@@ building the show@@ down becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in the regions of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan , first and foremost , needs all the friends he can get after he has enth@@ ron@@ ed almost his office last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late ais@@ le ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry at the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge of the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state leader won a bonus for claiming that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he called for support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel bad and now become alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both the pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even understand the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately mis@@ ses it to answer a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey f@@ lowed the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s head of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself , when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange can be changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we now become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but to pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved his 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
he put a milestone on his local race track with his second win of the night .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy about New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the jubil@@ ation when he gets the victory on Pre@@ men@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ minute winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career goat &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect distingu@@ ishing him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma has delighted fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already claimed 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament ho@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years of winners , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race but beyond that he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Dis@@ cs to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
&quot; and he is not yet at the end , D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50 years of age . &quot;
Russian Putin firing squ@@ ad Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has certainly dism@@ issed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a vice president since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief of the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls for the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works like he for the Soviet secret service the K@@ GB .
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president to run the Russian environmental policy once upon a time - came across a great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - you could say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the German Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers joined the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; ceiling fans , &quot; which are near@@ ing completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown took a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone for every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is the trend @-@ setting high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the expansion of the North tower , we had to close the gap to the north or the shore . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team works , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while moving their boat from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat sp@@ un around and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishermen &apos;s boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hanging on a bow without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board the coast guard and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat motor had an emergency stop , but this triggered the boat from the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened these men today .
badly injured - man sm@@ ells on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic do@@ er cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old , the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street she met the ex @-@ wife of the man .
&quot; when the two wives entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building inexpensive apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens are saying : investors should take much more responsibility in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first of all it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a scheme is missing so far .
&quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban surfaces must be able to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the political groups at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to introduce investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; despite this , so Brat@@ mann , there is a sharp@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program does not yet fully stand : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how does one compens@@ ate for the loss of more than 1300 affordable housing that will exp@@ ire over the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; for in the west city , at the end of the year , Fri@@ sts are running out . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for affordable housing .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the apartment building companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dras@@ tically , one can be removed from the target of so @-@ called interference . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be no movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U needs to go into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; teen@@ ager and child no longer go out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their spare time on screens , star@@ ing on screens , has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s were created . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture fell in interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphone outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once found , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users recently , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launch of the game , the number of downstream people who exercise every day 30 minutes , increased from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that will bring people to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; on de@@ af ears , because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look aw@@ k@@ ward . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances of becoming cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also towers that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be recre@@ ated with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es manages gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now finally also the Olympic winner .
&quot; on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year old American gymn@@ ast inv@@ aded the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes , under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot;
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ ap@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the individual competition of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation , the best of her generation , or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as the unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected a final test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between it and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace each other , after they have won gold and silver in the sing@@ ular multi @-@ competition in@@ ale of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ sie grab@@ bed the first medal on Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ lie insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long way , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ afa fell slightly by two turns , the picture was mur@@ ky . &quot;
Swedish Bal@@ cons and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ red .
&quot; she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam , and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embr@@ aced her sof@@ tly than she expected her end - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of R@@ ais@@ man was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal passed in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ ap@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man captain , named by the Americans &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; &quot; had a margin . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared du@@ bi@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ers while listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , killed in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first mass mur@@ derer from Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder was not the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y of rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at , if they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residence areas within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , in the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown cruci@@ fix from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which aimed at an empty picnic @-@ truck half an hour before the triple murder , and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ j@@ acks and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his contemp@@ or@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I won &apos;t . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left it on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ ling until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle cycling .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the language that Ed@@ mund has thought out for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a drawing language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not typical Sign Language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I asked continuously , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know it .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I do not expect them to really tell me someone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call on the Emergency Level on Friday . it will be calculated throughout Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ iana and the South of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Edwards informed that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the en@@ quiries for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags are increasing . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louis@@ iana to Saturday .
the weather service could be vo@@ iced lou@@ dly that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in rain .
&quot; in the south of Panama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while in the area Mobile continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Louis@@ iana , will likely reach record level throughout the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a flood @-@ east@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , arrived at 09.@@ 00 on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , rose strongly overnight . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , warned him . &quot;
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and pouring in the water , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a flood of river in the 48 years , where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; had spread quickly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning by 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was considerably su@@ pers@@ eded by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities reported that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and educational trip in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ator in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had 200 in@@ und@@ ated houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , now both were floo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had res@@ cu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , who were washed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency lod@@ gings were arranged to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; once the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants were provided for taking away , which hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar occurrence .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his details , a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as floo@@ ded , but on Friday none of them have been reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents reported that Brown suffered several shots , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transportation . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by balls , &quot; he shared Del@@ ors Mel@@ odi@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was considered cri@@ tically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the sender that he is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , fired up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a bon@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wed the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be several armed fighters involved here , who were very active , &quot; said police @-@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of Police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also met in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police , according to reports , report@@ edly checks the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse r@@ ack@@ et at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic reign in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , rounds off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ering . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ inen . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the peak of this sport , but so do not look for sports classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to get it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic crew will have four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who are responsible for training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their whole training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have exercised their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the municipalities a my@@ riad of young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy to access exercise training . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation 20 years ago .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport .
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for training and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team of team and thank you for so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; assistance doctors would like to organize further strikes , after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal . &quot;
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve the care at un@@ stable times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assistance physicians communicated last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current occupation crisis and it will give up to all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes caused by talks by the government to take part in ad@@ vers@@ ation and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was what Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the worries of the assistants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to perform further work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to provide doctors on strike chain coverage . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better week pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors , who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Staff , called for the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures achieve nothing but little , but already strain over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and break . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the assistant doctors committee and responded positively to the concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from professional training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the health ministry regarding compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart rate risk
&quot; thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the inhibit@@ ing drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffers from a further heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty acids in the ar@@ tery walls , which form floor@@ coverings . &quot;
&quot; when the flooring dis@@ appears , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ log blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the book by N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effectively in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets election sc@@ ans flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to the release of a government report .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread suff@@ rage in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today disclosed .
&quot; the former head of the cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles verb@@ ally att@@ aches the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now an antagon@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of election cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a passport , in order to prove their identity in the elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person if they release their votes , in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves against voting rights , but also the municipal government to protect against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court ruled that the reig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which a person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ ar@@ ming the frau@@ dul@@ ent letters of letters - for the older members of the Muslim community to have put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including the guidance of expos@@ ures to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Lebanese backgrounds . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit the letter selection documents to stop &quot; voting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing to vote .
use non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter of letters .
ban that political activists edit full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of post @-@ elections .
the police force the authority to set up lock@@ outs for electoral stops .
a change of legislation facilit@@ ated an indictment because of inti@@ mid@@ ation following the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
photographer ban in electoral stops .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually asser@@ t that voters go alone in the election booth .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Tribunal has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check @-@ up controls &quot; &quot; of the sel@@ ections of the town halls . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the tri@@ bunal in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spreading of vot@@ er and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ gers of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have won this week with the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , apart from the edge and band , which has proved to be an impressive double end in the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ism is by far not the only ath@@ lete in this summer , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you can give faith to social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics , which show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain bow of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I guess that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ ap@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one ais@@ le higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ sts Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot;
a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons are K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alist in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own wonderful , broad smile that resembles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; as a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Canadian station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; flew off &quot; &quot; and during the race , like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he ended up with his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ 0m outdoor swimming pool .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went like a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , spon@@ ge the second stage of the swimming st@@ aff@@ le 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Canadi@@ ans to complete the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; is like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
I@@ di@@ ot did not get that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost its connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard in which many people asked him
&quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard , how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like rac@@ ists . # an@@ gled .
&quot; shortly after Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter at the end . &quot;
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we regret it sincer@@ ely that these statements have been made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the mission and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the float , not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman who tried under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of business
buyers didn &apos;t know where to see when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered as she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she continues to browse and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mar@@ row shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that her did not fall down and went out .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with home , who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the garments from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she hadn &apos;t been washed .
&quot; a speaker from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been pulled out of sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Verb@@ andes in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind you should turn around first , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit him with the knees in the bar and twist , while the Att@@ acker kr@@ ill out of pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to sur@@ pass your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right scrap@@ es for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and the stran@@ gen@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most fragile places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k crashed his train on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before empt@@ ying any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ aking the sink head of a pulling toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public money at stations to r@@ ins@@ ing no@@ zzles of toilets , the task was definitely placing his immune system under a rehear@@ sal &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample score showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their L@@ umin@@ ometer was more than 4000 units , while newly washed hands have one of less than 60 units . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; showing the bacterial count in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This is close to the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; I &apos;m not going to dock here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company supplies Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support gut bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to view and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film director , added : &quot; let me say so - I &apos;d lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instruc@@ ted him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock , and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associated l@@ actic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they had at least occasionally used products containing added l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were tos@@ sed after a long list of complaints about their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the apartment association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were cl@@ inging holes on , wooden boards were torn , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was emb@@ ell@@ ished to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ kers and flu@@ xes included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name stood on the rental contract , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; it was in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the lum@@ ber pil@@ es were pil@@ ed up . &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
&quot; Corn@@ wall housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner viol@@ ently by the property , after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer . &quot;
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors , saying that their life was made to hell . &quot;
one said : &quot; they didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we rose up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the church , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant den@@ ounced to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step in consideration of Corn@@ wall housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case since the behavior was extreme , and their actions were horrible for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti@@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house following the del@@ og@@ ation on the ground
house@@ keeping workers will now have to dream gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in trade .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died during a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ led with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police say they will del@@ og@@ ate rent@@ ers , who do not adhere to the house rules &quot;
&quot; Angela C@@ row from De@@ von and Corn@@ wall reported that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not adhere to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ ick@@ ed after a ti@@ res@@ ale military jet flies
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of their life &quot;
a port@@ ug@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces placed an unbelievable blow flight
&quot; the air forces reported that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety risk was present . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists start to panic , after having a ti@@ res@@ ale jet@@ ty over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ists ran@@ ged as they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds to them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the dark and unbeliev@@ ably deep .
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast , and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that because of the bad visibility of the area , the jet lag a bit deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , where four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - so deeply , which limits his point of view . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans enter the Spanish Super@@ cup down@@ ward against FC Sevilla , the re@@ play three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Double@@ gew@@ inner has to ref@@ rain from the sub@@ du@@ ed cup@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europa League champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , competing with Brazil the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
also there is also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
&quot; the German suffered a devi@@ ation in the knee during the training , whereby the request at Bar@@ ca was at least determined in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing in Barcelona for two years around the status as number one .
&quot; so far , coach Luis En@@ rique ren@@ ounced a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other cont@@ ests took the lead . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness state of the team , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . were not really convincing , even at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ Port@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; again Sevilla again has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with up to now , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
MA Long in one &apos;s own league to table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma long is the new table tennis Olympic Champion .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; &quot; defending champion &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the world rank first was the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam , &quot; with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and for time @-@ outs , they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
they had pulled back on the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches to this point I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts pos@@ ing with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent , Ma had to fight only in the first set . &quot;
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the record and let Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; by the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected stir@@ ring match was developed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , nevertheless , a sufficiently stunning ball@@ ast change was to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White Russians had suffered a ri@@ pping injury , after that he had to settle in sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , were in similar high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Fourth . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in the traditionally conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot;
the presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now had weaknesses of his campaign campaign in the present repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ old of Utah .
a rare moment in which the generally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire has expressed as little as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals in the race &apos;s own repub@@ lican camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; the blame is false reports of his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ olds fur@@ nish
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ U.S. in June , Tr@@ ump and his competitors were syn@@ onymous with the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is custom@@ ary for repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , also Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; whether afterwards : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he does not do anything else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of political correctness , it would be fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump Party should have threatened to cancel mon@@ ies for the support of his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans wanted to get stronger under the arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympic : thre@@ ef@@ old fraud at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s ath@@ lete threat@@ ens after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee announced to promptly set up a disciplinary commission , in order to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; an Ethiop@@ ian function@@ ary announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine rehear@@ sal in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership Ken@@ yan by the dop@@ ing control engineers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has investigated the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to rig@@ or@@ ously follow its own investigations , divided an IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was stated in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and presented itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample delivered and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes , who stood on the list for the training controls of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing WM fourth over 800 meters .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics delegation , Michael Rot@@ ich , was with@@ drawn from the Rio Games . &quot;
he should be informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments in his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return at the airport in Nairobi . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after several dop@@ ing experiments , Kenya has been under special observation since the IO@@ C . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls in front of Rio games , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks before Rio games were noted earlier that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games begin .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took away from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports from the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; it has been proven that in this sport , surface @-@ covering and systematically tr@@ acked . &quot;
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ steins &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she reminds me of her love with Tony while the younger Maria is playing and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in every movement , in his looks , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ertor@@ rique went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was alleged that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the Group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had prepared to leave the war@@ med country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it to go into a war zone - to prevent people from ever meeting this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from East London got into a plane in direction to Turkey and then take a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ anas Family was told that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and became a wi@@ dow within a few months . &quot;
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will stay in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land as candidate for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Gar@@ land to select &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked with Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nomin@@ ee , be mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; Tre@@ ats wants n@@ ape calendar for &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Tre@@ ats magazine is collabor@@ ating with photographer David Belle@@ mere , to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top Models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distingu@@ ishes itself , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he believes that the Calendar also does . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nude , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community expects mass acc@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kur@@ dish Community of Germany expects the short term , with tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the president , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh for@@ estation of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the attempted coup attempt , Kur@@ dish Community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had mig@@ rated Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions against months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are escap@@ ing from Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the wart@@ ed put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which even takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the verb@@ and@@ ess accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the rip @-@ up to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or sold in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the Association of Represent@@ atives demanded that the German government is &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is taking place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I feel no longer confident in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ followers destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks , before the coup , presented the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognized for political persecution in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all eligible for asylum ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey they do not find themselves worthy of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not receive anything from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; and so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and weather conditions - that bit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced of the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country on Us@@ edom , Rügen , or Hid@@ den@@ see are not inhabitants , so are not allowed to choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , infl@@ ate the posters , distribute air ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on votes simply lab@@ ori@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania must once again let the people pass over . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can tell it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be worried about his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with people , just as he did his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaign at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale pro@@ positions twice ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the audience didn &apos;t agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it also pity no one from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel is listening . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaigns on market places and before shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that means co@@ ca@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that , on the land , you br@@ ittle the basis that it has to be very stringent , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ se of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should create the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays , and they spend their campaign largely on the internet . &quot;
&quot; online campaign , &quot; it calls the head @-@ president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tors go on track search for domestic stimul@@ ators among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the Spitz@@ enk@@ an@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ ses straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : Gast@@ stätten suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; praise will also be the case for those responsible for construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been rated on Monday to the south and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation inside the village has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer , Florian King , responsible for the technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ stre@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sne@@ aks sought and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas have been fran@@ ch@@ ised .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality demanded to ampli@@ fy the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable over@@ laps , &quot; says King , who made himself the position himself . &quot;
there have already been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 hours of hour in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation has led to revenue bur@@ gl@@ aries , everyone lets us look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z talks of a &quot; maximum light decline , &quot; but also adm@@ its that of course &quot; the sc@@ outing is missing . &quot; &quot;
the strongest are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the inn@@ s made it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about each euro sales .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
road @-@ cens@@ oring has thrown back its operation &quot; two years ago . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss the half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dism@@ issed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation with the hint , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now , they also have to bear the draw@@ backs that arise through the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other Land@@ sc@@ apes where something more generous has been handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his host will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one can &apos;t go down , it is also beautiful elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; that his master @-@ climate returns to the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly being screw@@ ed up . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presents a big security package . &quot;
but what has a D@@ ul@@ cer@@ al status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; as Minister of Interior , however , he is concerned with results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to fail before presenting its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; however , they are all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; some are already known , pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ated , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the cr@@ acking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger dates and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dual citizenship the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he does not consider this to be reasonable and also requires nothing , which in the coalition partner doesn &apos;t have any chances anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he is planning quick @-@ procedure for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ecting people from deportation .
&quot; refugees trained specifically in the country , should leave their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety check . &quot;
&quot; in the case of D@@ ul@@ lam for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some still have an effect and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some point , in the un@@ equal treatment of pati@@ ently for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it can &apos;t be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; and things , which the people deeply employed , did not settle down in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enorm@@ ously put into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are competitions . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties it went very high . &quot;
&quot; only a bold dispute over the equi@@ pping of the federal police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a revers@@ al of dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he does not keep anything . &quot;
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to re@@ open , do not make sense . &quot;
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional complaints . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause contro@@ versy .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to make a profit on the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming through .
&quot; in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the ex@@ tradition figures are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but it is not running in all markets .
there are vor@@ tices in the recall campaign about a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year when it comes to deliveries .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and a number of well running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can forward a plus further thanks to its many brands and some well running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened its total sales , like the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe alone , after China , the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s months . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries rose by almost a sixth . &quot;
sales head Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July above all to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has given a buying back in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted coup in Turkey , the British vote on leaving the EU also stressed , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas sc@@ ars first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected home mark of the Lower Saxony is further deterior@@ ating by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an output minus of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance sales plans from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period , worldwide 5.@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen was manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust @-@ test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative impact . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car manufacturer places the customer a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate after the conversion , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was named on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reasons are legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen would now grant its German customers a guarantee for diesel @-@ powered diesel models .
this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion , no deterior@@ ations take place and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen even uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was named in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the conversion , customers come to a workshop for example , and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , comes to a uncertainty regarding possible guarantees of warranty as it was . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in the future , as a second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : normal Spar@@ es do not have to fear , to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; deposit banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay for their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to deposits or c@@ ash@@ less accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for quite some time , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs now continue . &quot;
&quot; just leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank draft . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative federation of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry them alone , &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian folk and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines in 2014 with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private clients have to pay comprehensive compensation for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , which is more luxuri@@ ously equipped by fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if it boun@@ ces free money . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live . &quot;
&quot; at present no further banks are known for the cooperative association of Bavaria , which calcul@@ ates a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German National Bank and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually purchases vinyl records ?
lonely men of middle ages love plates .
&quot; before heading to the comment section , to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non@@ all@@ usion men &apos;s middle age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resurrection of records does not affect a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able buyer group . &quot;
&quot; it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors , it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I wear a modest gray suit in the middle of a busy street before I stop , hold my hands and give something certain as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o gets lost in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - still there is a handful of fantastic plate speci@@ als . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops , trying to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 from S@@ ister Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of Units : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess so , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and ready . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets to meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are promp@@ ted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have emp@@ tied their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom of followers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took imp@@ etus on the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some board fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that cause happy adjustments . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
it &apos;s like a collector and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee in@@ still@@ ed from a pile stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet listened to . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not own record player . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I fli@@ pped through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Units : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone recently came pure here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put them onto shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ like , less musi@@ kl@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only slowly enter . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I am going to go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged teenagers . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts New Test@@ ers and sex@@ ist Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ps from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
&quot; none of them looks strange lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ ma is hard to compreh@@ end if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it is rather a shopping spre@@ e than a big shopping cart .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression to pattern the jeans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young age girls who are group@@ ed for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er , who super@@ vis@@ es nothing against middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders . &quot;

French court ref@@ uses offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of trial hearing this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp produce goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a risk of fire and san@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as free meals which are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also concluded that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated in profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum affairs for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that closing &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of migrants in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers throughout the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance at the Olympic time , the professional driver Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mi@@ st@@ able twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly say it was hard to comment on the passing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he must analyse in peace , which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;
&quot; at the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed over the past few years .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ er must adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are being tested , which are to be se@@ duc@@ ed particularly effectively . &quot;
&quot; for example , the futur@@ istic tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident focuses , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with a temporary speed police , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through prohibited by time , distance and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven condition , one can move the trailer by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to cl@@ ad , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way disappear the outer outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to specifications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities are also using the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 units last year . &quot;
Britain pic@@ ks silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold pic@@ ks up gold
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is on Thursday evening , when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro stage . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ st@@ eppe , back@@ rest , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic gold medal . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was won by the not too bad price of silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is boss coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost among Ryan each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks of GB@@ s for fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. on , as if one would run into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was caught in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; an hon@@ orable T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mountain of Sierra Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ aza Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua out in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team , and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate . &quot;
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to pause .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK still cores . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the ji@@ hadi@@ st gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long been running in favour of the South African s@@ ulp@@ hi@@ sts , whose fans sang , wav@@ ed flags and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and the UK kick@@ ed off in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a short half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no more remote gold than in these games and that will mean what &apos;s hot .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present when they ru@@ ined the second Olympi@@ ad in the second without a tax lady in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ - un@@ finished action , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph@@ al arch . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was no one more lifting than the coach , who didn &apos;t know before 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer this day . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he is spreading everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment early in 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; the immedi@@ acy of the victory went their first thoughts to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ riding morning with it a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en , and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t have wished for a better person or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to finish , p@@ anning and glo@@ vers had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very well caught in the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not ready to do something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic host . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years provided for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small French drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
it was some time ago in the original alt@@ on in a contribution of the Bay@@ erische Rund@@ fun@@ ks .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Francon@@ ia served the co@@ er@@ ci@@ on association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old employee , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 65 , he was retired . &quot;
&quot; the Dr@@ inking Water Association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , supports around 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities Kirch@@ nois@@ ier , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply agreements for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was employed as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Pur@@ pose Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched out from the pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organization activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency calls at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high capacity vessels ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ distribution of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stal@@ em@@ ate and there are still new additions , because water is poll@@ uting and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association , and he regularly lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken district . &quot;
&quot; for that , he received a great deal of recognition and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was Ow@@ ned Ow@@ ner Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a loyal fan .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ build and restructuring of the forced association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were , however , the pipe break at the high reservoir at church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because you filled the high tanks of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water management association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who joins the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man sho@@ ots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( circle of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45@@ am and wounded them to death .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly tra@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police has published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man bears a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , is supposed to call the 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lübeck , at first , did not want to make any information about the Ta@@ eric or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but she affir@@ med that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a deli@@ ri@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to eye witnesses , a special operation command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which the sector threatened from the cost of green electricity , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transformation in the existing systems for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; own electricity production &quot; &quot; in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
&quot; I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations , we could finally reach it . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , all an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will be replaced . &quot;
but even these are not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for Power Generation .
&quot; with this , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
the successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , that is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fy as the world &apos;s largest producer country , given massive steel to the world market , given the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers throw off Chinese steel conc@@ essions price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , tra@@ ded import duties on imported steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have emerged . &quot;
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have rather stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude lock@@ ings of single works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic association steel informed on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity went back the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : singing the sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s study , she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German retirement league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by regular meetings , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures settle at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and to organise , to be able to rely on others and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
because the sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who demands his lungs regularly gets out of the pu@@ ste even in everyday life .
&quot; even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association for Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in elderly people w@@ akes up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia reli@@ ed on long back events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head also demands a special achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; elderly people , who live alone , do not only focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and a@@ wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces me . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby doesn &apos;t hesitate , even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , senior citizens have various options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , one can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
&quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , please contact the church or church leader . &quot;
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet search . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to all ages .
cats react more sensitive as han@@ go@@ vers on cri@@ es of the young
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the ru@@ ff@@ ing of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise , the males did not leave the males cold - however , in contrast to the females , they always beha@@ ved the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ ch@@ ew@@ ing of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who in great need choose how scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) found out . &quot;
K@@ aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ stress of less and strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten @-@ cri@@ es were different with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight female companions were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a little bit of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample rate for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cri@@ es , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this rowing of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off . &quot;
this ability may possibly be wor@@ sen@@ ed or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males responded to all at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in the past . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; to Super@@ cup &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ks@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ks@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , Turkey will again take place another important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be com@@ promised after the arrest of the emergency in July after the attempted coup attempt in July . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who are responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
it is not possible to stop football even before football .
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ks@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ k@@ r is to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the attempted coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of exception for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , it has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the village of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the gru@@ b of Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ sieger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially given to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 victory step . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the South per Li@@ g , it only ran@@ ged to sixth place . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season records as the South per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ch King . &quot;
this is also the reason the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; after the attempted coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez , which was signed by the AC Florence under contract , had announced that it would not return to his EM @-@ holiday due to the political situation in the country . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; club head F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stor@@ mer would have to be ready to ref@@ rain from around one @-@ third of his annual mil@@ eage to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still Med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has already been locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other exagger@@ ated athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian float Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compl@@ ained about the game after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly sli@@ pped off and tu@@ cked off at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with an open smile she was still stum@@ bled into the hall and prov@@ oked her performance .
&quot; when he was arrested , that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering tower . &quot;
&quot; but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had already been banned for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champions runs even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , I had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ ability and was locked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws of this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , stepped into Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ed , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ lete had been recognized as many medals afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having seen testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to release Olympia @-@ silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was with@@ drawn due to a judgement of the International Sport@@ Court of Sport .
&quot; with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he is in rank 2 of the world rank list . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record holder and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell off and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; they suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left them again . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens affected , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai army killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , according to the authorities , another person was killed . &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
a taxi driver was injured when det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a city . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower planted in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said Army al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves with potential motives , but probably it is the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that were typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities had received secret reports of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; it is still un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police instruc@@ ted their officials all over the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not turn to tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) landed for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environs . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday lasted a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is heading towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is holding itself good to restore the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the rebel@@ li@@ ous rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost one year ago , Bangkok had been killed in a hit on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; &quot; is entered into the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Compl@@ aints . &quot;
&quot; after several national offices , the Federal Constitutional Court also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identical movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; multi @-@ ult@@ i @-@ j@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - are already observing the &quot; identical . &quot; &quot;
&quot; during the decision , Ma@@ zen said his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the same Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
that is not a concrete advertisement for your own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; identical &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; saying , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the party - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; therefore , if such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with regard to the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ zen said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but we have seen in recent years that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that further legal @-@ terrorism group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee shei@@ men or attacks from other far @-@ right extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide governance of right @-@ wing terrorism should not be recognized . &quot;
the existing groups were developed at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many people went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects from attacks on asylum accommodation have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated crimes or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who have then radic@@ alized themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; not always , the Olympics or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a 48 @-@ second set@@ back and finished the 59@@ th position of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names took the lap .
some media recorded it as &quot; ro@@ uble of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre @-@ free @-@ style , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games in Sydney in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; memorable was the appearance of the swimming pool in Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ race over 100 meters of free @-@ style . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired back then .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the imp@@ ending electoral defeat so narrow
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; should it be nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then travelled to the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of political correctness , it would be fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; in a nut@@ shell , the corporation wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; from the coming year , the post aims to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been testing for months whether they are sold to their self @-@ developed spre@@ aders , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ board member Jürgen Ger@@ der had said , there are always inquiries , such as craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon want to enter the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post office factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ der had announced that the Group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long term , a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K replaces his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ ors suddenly came - but not quite un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him . &quot;

&quot; on the 1st of September , the management of the Management Board took over the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; Executive Board &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the tail@@ ors , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;

accidents - bus sli@@ ps in cro@@ up@@ es in dit@@ ches : eight injured
&quot; during an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her specification , which was partly on the opposite lane . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade freed the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident location on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ finished travellers were brought back by a bus back to the Kr@@ umm@@ ers district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a substitute bus for the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of waste water are from October 1 , 2016 for the area of sanitary facilities Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3,@@ 44 instead of so far 2.10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the sewage charge will be increased later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after over@@ l@@ apping calculation , the se@@ wer price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the hom@@ olog@@ ation of the house by the council office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ coverage for these wast@@ ewater treatment plants was established . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of legal basis , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee , a new calculation of fees for the sewage treatment of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ coverage from the previous calculation period may be compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wer systems with a very low waste water attack , Schmidt founded the gra@@ ving fee increases , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ewater treatment in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; last but not least due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses were in a considerable amount due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the food industry , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater facility .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dischar@@ ged from the ground up and the sewage slu@@ dge had to be disp@@ osed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility had to be installed in order to keep the ground@@ water requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into account . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly lower than the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that at low waste water in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance are full . &quot;
&quot; during the past 20 years , Schmidt added , the market community of large entertainment costs has been spar@@ ed in the wast@@ ewater treatment plants over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to stone houses , the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater association around these facilities because it is a sanitary facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria accounts for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ mon@@ at of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ ons critici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure , which could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ compressed , self @-@ winding tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all false doctr@@ ines come to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of propag@@ ating black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the indign@@ ation were spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters rather than car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an email Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student whose twe@@ et was broad@@ cast@@ ed far more broad@@ ly , that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable and &quot; &quot; said in@@ convenient . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not secured , but that the yellow face was pulled into the wi@@ dening extrem@@ ity . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed as their older counter@@ part in the breed - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult to keep such things un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rac@@ ist conventions reflect a lack of diversity in the introduction practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also critic@@ ised the large part of white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , focused on sub@@ divided population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also said they will close their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; fake IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions on the ground were allowed to report in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican members of the Ar@@ med Forces Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Military Intelligence Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command &apos;s secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information that were typically kick@@ ed off by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism , as it would allow the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements were clearly more positive than the facts before the congress . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com commander publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Congress of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force after they were assigned that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com Reports by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense are underway . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings in agreement with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely restricted process for the creation of intelligence agencies on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; proclaimed the moral among analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats did not give any evidence to the White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor who were taken up after complaints about Cent@@ com &apos;s analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , issued a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the investig@@ ators of the general inspec@@ tor are still ongoing . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigation has carried out re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds on dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , dra@@ fted a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush intended only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker confirms that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional oil refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s &apos; dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after hitting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever did . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; it knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch , which will lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ res . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team , started to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work sp@@ ens@@ um in London that we have now .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ruin completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gates in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
&quot; India was gone into play without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and took the ball in the gate to give the American women a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a swi@@ ft squ@@ ad@@ ron between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning staff , who is handed over from the wrist to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours &apos; conversation in the coff@@ shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who was at the Olympic Games for the first time and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV ads when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event alike .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I tend to make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years so spar@@ ingly that many who I had inter@@ viewed did not know that it is at all an olymp@@ ic portal . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will be defending their gold medal in London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ lown school as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a ge@@ aring enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has a hum@@ our@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never ending boun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports , which are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are evaluated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the exit wall , but also another stron@@ gh@@ old in the tel@@ ev@@ isions : the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator too . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers an at@@ ru@@ ction .
the V@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics only can be .
&quot; the skill and ending of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end times as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - how the male US gymn@@ asts suggested recently , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; prot@@ esters , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , are calling for violent resistance to the government . &quot;
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police at gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ aken the country and spread out into more and more areas .
&quot; last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security professionals hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Department now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa , and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shuttle train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a large @-@ critical vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ating front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden who were forced to use tur@@ mo@@ il more or less during the last years .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess will explo@@ de under the surface after years of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphone became more and more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what they are doing at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stay . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians believed that they were so prot@@ esting .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from eth@@ ia , predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas . &quot;
but this too changes .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos areas .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the Prime Minister of the Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia witnessed such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , seemingly mort@@ ally fed by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids were killed many prot@@ esters , even though there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new shuttle train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ hor@@ rence of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ an city , conducted by Tig@@ ray and hatred of the Tig@@ ray , is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flight @-@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently concluded that it has concluded this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; is a very thin walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s asser@@ tion that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not be the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot;
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sible with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , to explain the peculiar position , statements which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump rec@@ alled the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to we@@ aken Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement , remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism boun@@ ces down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this subject again .
he warned about Twitter announ@@ cing that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I meant sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits in politics and then rep@@ ay it as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both Can@@ did@@ ates . &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump assumed an even caus@@ al note , as his demand values declined further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leadership with a great margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but as he emphas@@ ises in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the un@@ convenient situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great efforts to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s testimony whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that in front of Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ woods , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton , served as a foreign minister to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being taken up against him . &quot;
&quot; he scor@@ ned the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologies as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were pushed out . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which sells verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native people smoked it as the last loss in a self @-@ prop@@ elled city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap transaction . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ bel@@ ated club Cafe opened last November at Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and CEO of the new coffee bar . &quot;
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered him to provide money funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ net as cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ted onions . &quot;
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the café serves no beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old clients were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she gave a while the coffee sink , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addi@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer . &quot;
he went there before work and always ordered the same thing .
&quot; I came after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not think that the soap business had taken hold of the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go down on her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the traditional , Polish inhabitants of green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands onto a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the appearance of the restaurant and the bri@@ dle felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ P &apos;s last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bri@@ ck@@ work in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; &quot; tells about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; the latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate . &quot;
&quot; when the rep@@ orter turned brown , this was the pair for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient . &quot;
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women costumes for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ els for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country per@@ ished to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food , such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole , became stap@@ le foods to re@@ use c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; as coo@@ ks could conc@@ eal un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of the American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mix@@ tures were tried out , because a cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen understanding . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at lunch , &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics carried out between 1923 and 1943 - such as the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by giving recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ Food @-@ attitude are tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he fed like the millions @-@ million man from the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully alien@@ ated from reality .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate a temple with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hired servant of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt said that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food deal , was disc@@ ar@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continued focus on cal@@ orie and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as to how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the storm in the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e emphasized a dessert that they had prepared at home : the dessert dessert that President Roosev@@ elt had lunch at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to give humble recipes a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ ved somewhat rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spoon into the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E fet@@ ched three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ tier@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died in a bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civilian protection group who according to Bild @-@ Zeitung saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life in the game , to pull people out of bom@@ bed homes and to make first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil guard , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of inf@@ ants from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as hero , he said in the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar even fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels of barrels above the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; the image rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland hai : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks occur usually only in winter to the surface .
&quot; after an examination on board the S@@ anna research ship , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea . &quot;
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks only get offspring with 150 years .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k runs along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour , it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal speed up to 2.6 km / h and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by lon@@ el@@ iness , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science , &quot; at least by a Greenland hai , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed for a long time , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only were the evidence missing .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks .
&quot; their time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ons were they , when they held six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the loo@@ t make this shar@@ k : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers that tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water layers .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much Carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; its birth should therefore remain after the early 1960s , as atomic weapons search for greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens core , on the other hand , contained a slight surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their len@@ tic@@ ular nucleus , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is not acci@@ dental . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon @-@ tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ agus . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should invest rather in a long life . &quot;

&quot; in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has dealt with issues surrounding construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee picked up the Communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently @-@ listed flats can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the plot , par@@ cell@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension phase 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ ly sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , visitors can contact the town hall as of now , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the gran@@ ting of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also make inquiries regarding the reloc@@ ation of further commercial firms , to be able to come up with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided not to change the area &apos;s development plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area there already has been extended by two plots towards the state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;

&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary buildings will continue to operate from London financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; , &quot; they have been admitted to the UK so far . &quot;
these are just large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; comp@@ utes with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Report ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , however , it is worse than Dublin in terms of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city with readily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the corporate consulting Merc@@ er , the city stands on No. 7 , Luxembourg to No. 19 , Dublin on No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; says I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my economic researcher . &quot;
&quot; the forces of forces also speak : in London according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba by the end of 2015 some 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US accoun@@ tant decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to reimbur@@ se the legal costs incurred from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which arose in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called o@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by mer@@ cs , including Mein@@ l &apos;s and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; in case of filing of law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of charge of Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the cost incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck conf@@ lic@@ ted each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , which is attribut@@ able to Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drug of Gilead . &quot;
the US supported troops say that they reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
&quot; the United States supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left in the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ tail@@ ed by the ex@@ odus of the still remaining group of fighters , who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , shared Shar@@ an Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just run out of clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; said Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced her tax return on Friday for 2015 , this resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation , the former President Bill Clinton reported an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s Can@@ didate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind the wrong pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax examination by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before the controls did not complete . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business units and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue , and on Friday published a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday she spoke about the subject , even during a speech to the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO announced that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxation during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a topic . &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the last week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump to discuss their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to an IR@@ S tax examination and tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has an effective tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that they were only USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike the majority of Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ man@@ des , fire@@ work bodies promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from living settlements , throwing con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the honey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the US natural protection by practicing volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Tel@@ eph@@ one Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant in doing so , &quot; commented the director of Honey@@ Girl Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cotton &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; the mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition line . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last chance represents a thro@@ wer , who sho@@ ots a gol@@ dre@@ dge fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects of commercial retailers with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - especially the retail sector in the core city are considered to be significantly out@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , the application for the new building of a sales ski on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ Baltic on the Rhine , however , declined unanim@@ ously . &quot;

Jewish director dism@@ is@@ ses Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media uprising , after announ@@ cing that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election since it requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s list of countries . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides a way to select Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more angry in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were app@@ alled and upset by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
&quot; the fact that this has taken place in Germany in precisely this hotel chain , is even an even greater dis@@ grace . &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged demands of Arabian guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed &quot; , &quot; said it to another post which was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly showed all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; Israel did not include in the election list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students gathered together with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they assembled to protest against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police set tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which resulted in the fact that the police set rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas chambers . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the govern@@ ors of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the preliminary president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in crowds went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar , with the lifting of the sanctions , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent between Moscow and Teher@@ an . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies increased sharply to shops in the country , shared the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an dates back to a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , Russian representatives issued around 3@@ 5,000 visits , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador is hoping that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
wanted : beverage market floo@@ ded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been exer@@ ted on the beverage market by Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a gun bullet , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the drink market , and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police don &apos;t share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.70 m , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly visible .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators must be scann@@ ed in the direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fled from the gravel parking place on the gravel road with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations about the crime time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently call on the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : fun and fun in summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social ped@@ agog@@ ical day @-@ group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection association Nag@@ old with their super@@ vis@@ ors on their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; in the quietly situated leisure theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was accommod@@ ated during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the zoo . &quot;
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swimming and splash . &quot;
&quot; children and super@@ vis@@ ors were cul@@ tured with their own prepared body@@ work like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the Engl@@ ish@@ man @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were made , beautiful gem@@ s made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the spare time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings by the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned to their home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next European pilgrimage to all the mini@@ stries in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ rant @-@ General St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgri@@ m@@ ages were tested and one finally decided on the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y , the doors of mercy on Freiburg Cathedral were offered a special pilgri@@ m goal . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms were on their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , Par@@ ish Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m@@ ages and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster un@@ seen loving woman is standing and thus the pilgrimage route taken from the Münster cathedral . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field cru@@ ises , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made rest to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the parish priests of the local par@@ ishes stood at their disposal . &quot;
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast at the Et@@ app@@ enzi@@ elen .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that the stage came to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting trail , but at first some 500 meters of altitude had to be desc@@ ended and then again climbed . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue on the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; clearly facilit@@ ated and happy , Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Mu@@ enster in late afternoon and walked through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; in the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner thir@@ sts last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after having stayed in March at the London Championships in London , despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a hind@@ rance .
&quot; Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner wag@@ ered a Olympic Committee at the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a strategy change made a big part of the transformation that ran into a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; It is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have placed an Olympic Committee on the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der pointed out that after a weak start he was visi@@ bly reduced to the rail@@ road . &quot;
he later returned this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
there was no such problem for such an outstanding victory this time .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags at the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we went so badly with so many sur@@ titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year old Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at the end of 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , who won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will be focused on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had fought with officials before the qualification , when he called him function@@ aries to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition which continues tomorrow and ends , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on his strong web @-@ wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background so that the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April was in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ tices as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy yield question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , since the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2,000 work@@ stations - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects since the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting workshop with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt &quot; , &quot; the company shared . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging businesses &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the supplier of electricity . &quot;
all potential impact on income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; is not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still one explanation guilty of why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; because of the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn against the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land would consume around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago approximately 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner clan is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , cri@@ p@@ pled reality video showing the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z un@@ cle and producers of keeping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ ha@@ ete plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we forgot you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate somehow in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold out of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference similar to an illustrated book as a fashion journal , the issue pul@@ ls out a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista of the 8@@ 32 pages of the city &apos;s 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the disclosure of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the journal are still le@@ ak@@ ed before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models , &quot; the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like success to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot; &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled up again when the news came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to move around on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she has sold her paintings by C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centers aver@@ t 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary conditions are recorded annually by the municipal districts , while the sector is preparing for the impact of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and the like - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal advice . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already exploited over@@ ly , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s municipal coun@@ cill@@ ors , said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal law centres revealed that thousands of people have already been dism@@ issed each year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without any suspension of the German government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and crus@@ hing debts , families that have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dism@@ issed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Tax Minister as well as sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indic@@ ted after employees report@@ edly drag@@ ged weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina has directed a fire@@ arm to an employee in February , while they were in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
Bord@@ ini was waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before realis@@ ing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right foref@@ inger on the train , and took the run at Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini ordered in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; having compl@@ ained at the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was indic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini said . &quot;
&quot; the indictment only occurred two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , when he said a crowd in North Carolina , said that &quot; &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; - fire@@ arms and weapon friends - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media would have ri@@ pped his words from the context and that he would not stop violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence and Philip due to bodily injury and lasting psychological harm .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip just failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not responded . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : elections in front of countries elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are characterized by the governing party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could still reign in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD declined from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ uc@@ tant to return to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would , on the other hand , miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would date for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone comes with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro fans can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the age of the internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; &quot; Büro in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator could be reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , al@@ beit tor@@ r@@ ingly slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be worked similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
no one could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually being sold and wound to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today providers , who came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; still and everywhere online , this is everyday life for a lot of people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple , were alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless App vendors and the telecommunications corporations .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry was created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three instruments in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple began its triumph@@ al march , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had a look . &quot;
&quot; finally , she van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone even away , &quot; &quot; just said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; we will create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips for our local communities alone , creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will flash on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in wit@@ ty growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T2 that was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad block@@ age &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad block@@ age , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the enco@@ ding regarding its advertisements to make it spot@@ ting the recognition on which part of the page advertising is to be difficult to detect . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the time @-@ cur@@ bing Open Source Community and the trans@@ duc@@ ers has been going on since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indicator of how wor@@ rying display blo@@ cker has become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion every day active users , who access their mobile devices on Facebook , hand@@ y@@ advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has said it to ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers do not have an effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs is a big portion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preference tool , &quot; in order to have more control over its commerci@@ alized advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man on email . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman in presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police call on witnesses , after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday during a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles . &quot;
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark , &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill himself by several vehicles , including a truck , who wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who asked them as well as any witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a coll@@ ision avo@@ idance ?
&quot; that is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night on the highway , as stated in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become un@@ conscious on the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman answered -- who had responded to a call -- a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ am@@ o@@ dell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether Venus could have en@@ acted similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere , and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus exhibits its day side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planets explor@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to a great deal of heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt out by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations from the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low coefficient of co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations from the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I was thinking long and far about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
&quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions , which influence the performance of the team . &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pl@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the follow @-@ up in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tracks with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take talks again , put strikes &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles for the remun@@ eration for North @-@ sea oil workers are suspended , while all disputes for a new round of discussion were put to the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current strike , &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Wood Group short@@ ened the rates to its tra@@ ilers in the North Sea by some 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice is followed by a 10 @-@ percent decline for on@@ shore sur@@ fers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts are available to the company to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has dism@@ issed thousands of people and announced plans to impose its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alis@@ es its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest working struggles that took place in the North Sea for a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ run rotate at different rates , as well as in what context the rotation periods with planetary emergence are standing . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these mature stars run large amounts of star win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , when and why stars dec@@ eler@@ ated their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ads , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 year old professional will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 , against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; good@@ bye &quot; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a tenth @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the bas@@ eball Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the Super@@ star offered &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have accepted ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a winding in the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have obtained funding for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could have done a favor for 2014 , because I &apos;ve played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , at that time . &quot;
his f@@ arewell @-@ days were not running nois@@ el@@ essly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legend have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and confirmed the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , was sympath@@ etic to the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the disciples at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing accidents &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland should not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
an caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meters obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - just before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these news come to the un@@ timely . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International sports court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final about 100 m butter@@ fly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the runs over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and hearing was filed . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a press release : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Court of Technology and accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova also le@@ aked in the night of Rio , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old entered the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; The only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act on the banned substance . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov promptly reported to the ath@@ lete by criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ed nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; event , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days before . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is another major blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team except for the exception of systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , in addition , the earlier off@@ ences in China had also caused severe con@@ front@@ ations between the athletes . &quot;
thus the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun was the focus of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Daten@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses H@@ acker her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware currently attack companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by the malware protection specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , UK and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially lead ran@@ som is much higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the mal@@ icious programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als permanently .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients could be acute by the loss of patient records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the pay@@ load areas and the contact with the black@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit tot@@ als in order to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware recovery , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created using malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ berries are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminals and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per infected host .
&quot; usually the criminals entr@@ ust sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data . &quot;
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on protecting ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing systems , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future take completely new goals on the internet of things to the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the h@@ acker conference Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the release of such a block@@ aded heating system could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the rear , it does not affect any location . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit top is falling down . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l with high @-@ resolution and 10@@ 26 l in the back @-@ up back@@ rests , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ ett@@ les and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground to ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the boot is well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should make his work a bit qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine type : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top version &quot; Executive . &quot;
&quot; the security systems are part of the City emergency brake assist ( working until Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistance assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when sh@@ un@@ ting many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable the long @-@ beam assistant is working .
and the intelligent temporary developer respon@@ ds to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed if necessary .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , App integration and more . &quot;
two USB and an HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : falling down on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; because a liability is possible only for haz@@ ards , which are typical of aviation , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee @-@ iron in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay compensation to the man .
case of illness : when pays the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found without a doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negotiated case , a family was severely ill in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il lau@@ rels . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought back the holiday@@ makers to a defective sewage treatment , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water . &quot;
the family was the view that the voyage was thus flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
&quot; in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before leaving the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
&quot; especially since in the samples of the water , no imp@@ urities have been found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were detected .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , according to the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have concern for further attacks . &quot;
the state must be b@@ onn@@ ed and resol@@ utely react to terrorist threats .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and spl@@ itting . &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country faster , it will increase security and strengthen the population &apos;s consent for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement proposals to the 2017 Par@@ liam@@ entary elections .
&quot; he also announced another personal gain of the security forces , &quot; &quot; In a medium @-@ four @-@ digit scale over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire has been updated so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is particularly difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed Swiss duty for doctors is to be kept in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions as to reduce the risk of citizens , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against action .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the aboli@@ tion of dual citizenship before . &quot;
&quot; as a general ban on full @-@ wear , it is constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the bur@@ ka wearing . &quot;
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter threw the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate energy and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist packages . &quot;
left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; the fleet of pro@@ verbs and a ti@@ ghtening of the living right bring people in this country no more safety . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway exit
it is regularly st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but that should change : the right balance should be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all the car drivers , who stand in traffic at the ambient road every night in traffic , if they are driving over the motorway : Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the departure Wes@@ eler road the right @-@ hand bending trail around 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then turn right from the Hammer Road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : transport is spl@@ itting up early , whereby the overall procedure is improved on the most busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder nerves the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ st@@ au extends to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous eye on the B 51 is shortly before the exit of the Wes@@ eler road . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic is guided only one lane over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be disman@@ tled in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer possesses the required load force , in order to include mainly heavy @-@ load traffic in two lanes . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will continue , the competent state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining usable cycle up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the right balance , the Landes@@ betrieb deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on the building site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural travel : culture offers for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with migration and refugee interests to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 pupils from eleven to 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to explore the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee interests , has the opportunity to visit schools with will classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; most you@@ ths of the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and we@@ aken little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;

rain instead of star@@ ters : hope for better weather
the weather has made the star @-@ grab@@ ber Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly designed for clouds and rain , to observe the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many star@@ ches in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ schu@@ ppen is per@@ sei@@ zes , which are among the fastest cluster @-@ co@@ ves with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening you are rolling around for hours , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer thinking about sleeping a long time before the alarm bells . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ord and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in@@ som@@ nia and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; just the sleep feels a lot of people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association , with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind them can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is common , especially when it comes to depression , &quot; says We@@ blast . &quot;
and it can be that various factors are inter@@ tw@@ ining each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and may possibly start to sal@@ ute on everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I become a doctor with sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor .
&quot; impair@@ ment may look quite different : you have been beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there are hardly any vac@@ ant sleeping medicine in Germany , says Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Director of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in case of sleep problems , one should first turn to the atri@@ cian , tell us . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , for examination in the sleep lab , doctors recommend snor@@ ing with respiratory dro@@ p@@ outs , in case of sickness @-@ fatigue , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the test .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after ti@@ cking one goes to bed at its normal time .
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al cann@@ ula , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera on the ceiling distingu@@ ishes the sleeping . &quot;
how can affected people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
&quot; if you don &apos;t sleep in bed , don &apos;t sleep too long in bed , don &apos;t watch TV for sleeping , avoid smoking and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to expect immediately , and that &apos;s not at all con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has sold himself to the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
&quot; in December 2014 , he made gold for the first time at the world champion@@ ships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself against his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ates in the criticism standing in the criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle of € 150,000 , no one should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not really look at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time in front of the WC / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de of luggage th@@ iev@@ es arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf Police were able to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage racks as a gang .
&quot; at 9 : 30 a.m. civil servants recognized a gang in the area of Düsseldorf airport , which was known to the police officers from past theft charges . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid @-@ July , and were in a joint , job @-@ making and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime committee 34 can demonstrate four acts , which had been specially designed for criminal off@@ ences to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between , a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not look like that , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; passing the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a gray house .
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; article on this &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , but in recent weeks it is preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents now have lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , were cleared by 300 police officers , police pat@@ rol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three cl@@ ub@@ team cars on site , locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers were commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others conver@@ ge ahead of late Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left force is not the main source of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 and Jan@@ a * , who draws three children here , mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wants majority police protection from the fle@@ shock@@ ing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police put up between the land@@ owners and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter , which even today compared to the rest of the city a low average income and high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all the Main@@ zer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under great police orders in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the city of Riga and are partly inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing lin@@ ers from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 by new rental companies . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by disc@@ ar@@ ded pan@@ es or newly painted fac@@ ades that were disc@@ ar@@ ded with colour bags .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that crime is not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury , statistics are reported almost exclusively against police officers . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are certainly not . &quot;
the famous burning cars are no longer available in the R@@ ī@@ ga anymore .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the R@@ ī@@ ga Stra@@ it - and stayed .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that residents get back their street : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the authority over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through historical buildings built in former buildings , which displ@@ ace old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well @-@ beha@@ ved , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction cannot I appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should be done if someone never listen to someone ?
&quot; on all sides , there is fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for bred breeders who anno@@ y themselves about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub neighborhood , can complain about noise . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the asylum seek@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the management team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , Arbeits@@ kreis Refu@@ gee assistance , Administration , Auth@@ orities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now there , the s@@ uns@@ ung wool @-@ l@@ actic acid , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; for example , some - less ridicul@@ ous than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative trainer with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ins@@ ult of Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point of time for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ orable and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you must submit the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility altern@@ ates from the council office to the Commun@@ e and the Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search for some time has been very difficult .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find any private dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; so far , it didn &apos;t work so far , that one is dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ ter@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be carried out as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers are installed in the W@@ as@@ enstraße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and work @-@ aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be ti@@ led or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a firm structure , say deu@@ ter@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here also administration and community members jump . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees that it will take and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problem cases , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ter@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
that is all a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : after the recent incidents , the two have fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine customer clearly says , &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve call &quot; . &quot; however , a residual risk can and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would bring them completely into call .
&quot; they want to show that they don &apos;t have anything to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so major and volunteers have to look for activities on site and in the region .
&quot; in doing so , they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants to come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach has already begun to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar sought by helicopter
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .
the inhabitants surprised the two and defeated the de@@ for@@ estation in flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , probably m@@ asked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded swe@@ aters . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; on the one hand , the police set several strip @-@ positions as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ell@@ ation ran without success .
perhaps the unknown actually fell close to the apartment or in their escape .
