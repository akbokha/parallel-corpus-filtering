<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration, they pursued home to the forage troughs in fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I have had fear."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the equestrian career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was best golfers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he was led by his family over the anlage of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports assistance handed the man out of Anhausen within the framework of a small gala the Golden sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laurel leaf, Champions Tour player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">A long one is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has fostered the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the double US champion-winner was added to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports "on Saturday."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "however, the two US presidential candidates, however, are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the case of doubt, Trump wants to keep it small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to taxing the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive back on massive regulation, and he stands for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, says them."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the future, Trump and Clinton are almost wordless."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump we could still send party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-use coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, it wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and challenge renewable energies with its investment programme:" one country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time both the United States do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but rather protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, calls for Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be rinsed, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, stands to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics believe him, that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women who are fleeing themselves, almost everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the sector manager of Condrobs, a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised shelters for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs initiated the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Assistance."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors either.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopelessness," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there are other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced-compulsion, honoral morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is no rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they are in Germany, irre, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that approximately 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations only for them, asking Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is such a thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unter- and Mittelfranken, there are in some community-canceled floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing, or if men and women are accommodated together, it can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"first of all, the washrooms should be separate and accessible to women easily, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as much as the women feel this need of protection, one can read the urge which it gives to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">The assistant's deputies have called up their union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour combat measures beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant doctors and medical students agreed on the refusal of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" "persistently calm" "to problems, which resulted in the agreement being rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC Executive Committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requesting official new negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme of escalating work campaigns that begin in early September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that assistants of this year dispute, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the director of BMA's assistant doctors, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the election for rejecting the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny myself that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed stew, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, said repeatedly by his" loving friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved like that would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin emanating, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downpour of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was raging.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the going was even bigger, as it was done by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the showdown becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media launched a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited from illegal oil trade in the regions of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan, first and foremost, needs all the friends he can get after he has enthroned almost his office last month at a failed coup d'etat."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisle onslaught of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry at the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted transfer of power as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge of the snail-empo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state leader won a bonus for claiming that after the attempted coup d" état, he called for support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glittering palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent an" "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel bad and now become allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both the presidents met at the press conference that they didn't even understand the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately misses it to answer a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey flowed the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="16">"now I say that we do not pursue global goals, but to pursue local goals."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who was a vice president since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State of Moscow for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it is (in Russian) that he later became the chief of the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls for the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like he for the Soviet secret service the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"during a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president to run the Russian environmental policy once upon a time - came across a great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," "It's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - you could say - complaining about four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the German Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term would have violated Putin's constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers joined the North-deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing of the" ceiling fans, "which are nearing completion to each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown took a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first closure is a significant milestone for every bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is the trend-setting high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the expansion of the North tower, we had to close the gap to the north or the shore."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massively since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances on which the team works, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building inexpensive apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens are saying: investors should take much more responsibility in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "living concept" "for the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A scheme is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann comments:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban surfaces must be able to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is, so Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann:" there is no agreement between the political groups at the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to introduce investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, so Bratmann, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program does not yet fully stand: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compensate for the loss of more than 1300 affordable housing that will expire over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the west city, at the end of the year, Frists are running out."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the apartment building companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the west city is increased drastically, one can be removed from the target of so-called interference."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be no movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D Group president Holger Herlitschke said:" "for a broad majority the CDU needs to go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenager and child no longer go out to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their spare time on screens, staring on screens, has been sued by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990ies (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture fell in interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphone outside and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once found," photographed "(about a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person withdraws every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users recently, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launch of the game, the number of downstream people who exercise every day 30 minutes, increased from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that will bring people to" "come from the sofa" "and" "active every day" "on deaf ears, because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look awkward."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances of becoming cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also towers that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be recreated with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="14">"she broke out in tears, when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end."</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as the unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>

<seg id="17">"they expected a final test in Brazil, a competition which was not so much between it and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympic reign in the gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>

<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheering."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness lets election scans flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to the release of a government report.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread suffrage in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as an annihilating government report today disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former head of the cabinet of Sir Eric Pickles verbally attaches the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and municipal government, who is now an antagonist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of election cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should lead a passport, in order to prove their identity in the elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must simply name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable ink on the finger of a person if they release their votes, in order to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this not only serves against voting rights, but also the municipal government to protect against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court ruled that the reigning mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical manner" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman should have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarming the fraudulent letters of letters - for the older members of the Muslim community to have put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the guidance of exposures to prove the identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Lebanese backgrounds."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit the letter selection documents to stop" voting. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing to vote.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications to an automatic letter of letters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists edit full post-elections and envelopes of post-elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police force the authority to set up lockouts for electoral stops.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation facilitated an indictment because of intimidation following the 1983 Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographer ban in electoral stops.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations (except for Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees usually assert that voters go alone in the election booth.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Electoral Tribunal has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the ineffective" "check-up controls" "of the selections of the town halls."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the tribunal in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spreading of voter and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">Buyers didn't know where to see when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a primarrow to try underpants.</seg>
<seg id="3">"to worsen the situation, she numbered as she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">She continues to browse and tasted four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The primarrow shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone in which the woman tried the underpants before she put her back into the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear, she went back and left the business without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "The people couldn't believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when they pulled out the underpants, which you obviously didn't like, as they put them back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three further underpants before she finally decided that her did not fall down and went out.</seg>
<seg id="12">She didn't seem to disturb that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the underpants she had tried.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent said:" "how to think that someone would take shelter with home, who had a different person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Davidson added:" "as I got along, the staff tried to pull the garments from the sale after she went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she hadn't been washed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a speaker from Primark said:" "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products coming into question have been pulled out of sale.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching from behind you should turn around first, so that you can see your aggressor and" "go out of the shot line," "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"hit him with the knees in the bar and twist, while the Attacker krill out of pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and the weapon on it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright scrapes for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and the strangeneflex of a serious test - leaking some of the dirtiest and most fragile places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk crashed his train on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knob of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before emptying any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leaking the sink head of a pulling toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money at stations to rinsing nozzles of toilets, the task was definitely placing his immune system under a rehearsal"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample score showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison to this, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their Luminometer was more than 4000 units, while newly washed hands have one of less than 60 units."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "showing the bacterial count in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This is close to the worst thing I've got in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm not going to dock here, because it is disgusting here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company supplies Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support gut bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to view and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Lass to call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film director, added:" let me say so - I'd lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to dock, and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they had at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were tossed after a long list of complaints about their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the apartment association found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were clinging holes on, wooden boards were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was embellished to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strikers and fluxes included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47 whose name stood on the rental contract, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was in the property where drugs were traded in the past, the lumber piles were piled up."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Cornwall housing delogated her and her partner violently by the property, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the delogation was cheered by lightened neighbors, saying that their life was made to hell."</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: "they didn't care about anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We rose up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have had the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the church, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant denounced to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogation is always the last step in consideration of Cornwall housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case since the behavior was extreme, and their actions were horrible for their neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house following the delogation on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to dream garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine of money after having found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in trade.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died during a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after having been without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were graffled with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">"the police say they will delogate renters, who do not adhere to the house rules"</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall reported that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not adhere to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach as well as those who were harmed by such a behavior," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there is always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite jagged," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>

<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality demanded to amplify the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually purchases vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before heading to the comment section, to sow it under the pseudonym nonallusion men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed resurrection of records does not affect a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it is also not a hordes by hobby collectors, it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I wear a modest gray suit in the middle of a busy street before I stop, hold my hands and give something certain as:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho gets lost in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - still there is a handful of fantastic plate specials."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops, trying to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55 from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of Units: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess so," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when she appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and ready."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets to meet the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people usually have emptied their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of followers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took impetus on the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some board fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that cause happy adjustments."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">It's like a collector and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee instilled from a pile stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet listened to."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, do not own record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I flipped through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42 who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Units: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came pure here and said," "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put them onto shelf", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-like, less musiklastic."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who only slowly enter."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I am going to go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged teenagers."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts New Testers and sexist Pop instead of experimental jazz drumps from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange lonely, but nagging psychic trauma is hard to comprehend if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a shopping spree than a big shopping cart.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to pattern the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young age girls who are grouped for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who supervises nothing against middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of trial hearing this week argued the authorities in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp produce goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a risk of fire and sanity."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as free meals which are offered by the state-supported association and other groups, would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is operated in profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum affairs for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that closing" for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest are eight years old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of migrants in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number - following a steep increase in newcomers throughout the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis on Thursday evening, when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-steppe, backrest, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic gold medal."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was won by the not too bad price of silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it might be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis boss coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost among Ryan each game at Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks of GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as if one would run into driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau was caught in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"an honorable Tackle from Mitchell halted the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jaza Veremalua out in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the UK team, and stormed to the line to make a gate."</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to pause.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while the UK still cores."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the jihadist gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been running in favour of the South African sulphists, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the grandstand."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was all present when they ruined the second Olympiad in the second without a tax lady in a row, the first women in the history of British sport that put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.- unfinished action, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athlets who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal arch."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no one more lifting than the coach, who didn't know before 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer this day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, he is spreading everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment early in 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing itself is a challenge, but it makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the immediacy of the victory went their first thoughts to Williams, who spent a nerve-riding morning with it a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I and Helen, and also Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't have wished for a better person or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to finish, panning and glovers had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very well caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" stay in the process, stay in the process. ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not ready to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">"financial burdens, which the sector threatened from the cost of green electricity, are from the table."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Transformation in the existing systems for the so-called" "own electricity production" "in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations, we could finally reach it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, all an EEG levy of 20 percent will be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these are not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for Power Generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'steel is future', that is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are weakened," explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past year, the situation continues to intensify as the world's largest producer country, given massive steel to the world market, given the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw off Chinese steel concessions price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, traded import duties on imported steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have emerged."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have rather stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude lockings of single works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the economic association steel informed on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a brief upliftment in May, the produced quantity went back the second month in a row."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: singing the seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's study, she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German retirement league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by regular meetings, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures settle at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and to organise, to be able to rely on others and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">Because the seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who demands his lungs regularly gets out of the puste even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association for Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in elderly people wakes up many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia relied on long back events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head also demands a special achievement, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"elderly people, who live alone, do not only focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and awoke beyond me - this experience reinforces me."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to begin with singing, there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby doesn't hesitate, even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, senior citizens have various options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">"if you want to sing in a church choir, please contact the church or church leader."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="6">Katers also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"apparently, the acoustic differences between the mistress of less and strongly excited kittens for the males are either not perceptible or not of importance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding from MHH. "</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten-cries were different with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight female companions were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a little bit of little ones who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, who were additionally lifted up."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results despite the low sample rate for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the cries," said Konerding. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"they turned faster to the loudspeaker, when this rowing of the very excited kittens played off."</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be worsened or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>

<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames took the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media recorded it as "rouble of the whale."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the sewage charge will be increased later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after overlapping calculation, the sewer price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the homologation of the house by the council office Kulmbach, it was established that undercoverage for these wastewater treatment plants was established."</seg>
<seg id="5">"on the basis of legal basis, the market Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a new calculation of fees for the sewage treatment of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercoverage from the previous calculation period may be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in order to ensure that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewer systems with a very low waste water attack, Schmidt founded the graving fee increases, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the wastewater treatment in all three systems is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"last but not least due to their age, refurbishment and repair expenses were in a considerable amount due to their age of refurbishment and repair."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the facility in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the food industry, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf wastewater facility.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be discharged from the ground up and the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional aeration facility had to be installed in order to keep the groundwater requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "to these extraordinary expenses, the continued support and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came into account."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly lower than the current level in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">"stone houses made it clear that at low waste water in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance are full."</seg>
<seg id="20">"during the past 20 years, Schmidt added, the market community of large entertainment costs has been spared in the wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure, which could be of a Roy Lichtenstein paintings."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are uncompressed, self-winding tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All false doctrines come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past where they were accused of propagating blackface or white skin as beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and the indignation were spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters rather than caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an email Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student whose tweet was broadcasted far more broadly, that the filter was" "vulnerable and" "said inconvenient."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not secured, but that the yellow face was pulled into the widening extremity."</seg>

<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are diversed as their older counterpart in the breed - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," it is much more difficult to keep such things unnoticed than it was before, "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racist conventions reflect a lack of diversity in the introduction practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu also criticised the large part of white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>

<seg id="1">"fake ISIS intelligence information, establishes Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions on the ground were allowed to report in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Military Intelligence Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command's secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information that were typically kicked off by high-level Centcom commanders, posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism, as it would allow the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, stated."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements were clearly more positive than the facts before the congress."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom commander publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force after they were assigned that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom Reports by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense are underway."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings in agreement with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence agencies on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, as Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "proclaimed the moral among analysts and" gave excessively little space for divergent opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats did not give any evidence to the White House intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector who were taken up after complaints about Centcom's analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, issued a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the investigators of the general inspector are still ongoing."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has carried out repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honourable assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds on disagreements of more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, drafted a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush intended only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker confirms that the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional oil refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms' damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of its excessive positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after hitting three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever did."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it knows, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which will remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch, which will lead the other group."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vertebrae by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadres."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team, started to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work spensum in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the ruin completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gates in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone into play without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and took the ball in the gate to give the American women a 2-0 guided tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">As well as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late it is, it's the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constantly and inescapable, a swift squadron between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, who is handed over from the wrist to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours' conversation in the coffshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who was at the Olympic Games for the first time and a women's flock with dimples, could have been among these well-known names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV ads when he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I tend to make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years so sparingly that many who I had interviewed did not know that it is at all an olympic portal."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will be defending their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a gearing enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has a humouristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never ending bounce - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports, which are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling motions (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medallists have to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the exit wall, but also another stronghold in the televisions: the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator too."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an atruction.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics only can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the skill and ending of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end times as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - how the male US gymnasts suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"protesters, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, are calling for violent resistance to the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shaken the country and spread out into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security professionals hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Department now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa, and its stability is estimated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shuttle train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a large-critical vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-liberating front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden who were forced to use turmoil more or less during the last years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness will explode under the surface after years of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphone became more and more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what they are doing at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stay."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians believed that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from ethia, predominantly Christian high-countries, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of the Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia witnessed such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands were protesting against elections, seemingly mortally fed by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids were killed many protesters, even though there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new shuttle train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abhorrence of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an ampersan city, conducted by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray, is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for flight-flights across the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently concluded that it has concluded this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr. Abdi said," "is a very thin walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's assertion that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by attacking that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not be the" Founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensible with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, to explain the peculiar position, statements which he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump recalled the allegation on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to weaken Mr. Trump to weaken the statement, reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism bounces down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned about Twitter announcing that Mrs. Clintons would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clintons's emails, but later he explained" Of course, I meant sarcastically. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then repay it as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "depending on how the reaction expires." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both Candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump assumed an even causal note, as his demand values declined further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great margin in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general tries not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but as he emphasises in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the unconvenient situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave great efforts to defend the candidate in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumps's testimony whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that in front of Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backwoods, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton, served as a foreign minister to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being taken up against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he scorned the" poor, miserable "television experts trying to understand him and said," You cannot!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked on Mr. Trumps apologies as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland's water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COP's last book" "Chop Suey" "was Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickwork in her book" "97 Orchard" "tells about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, schnörkellosem Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter turned brown, this was the pair for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which stretches the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be placed in the stomach as lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women costumes for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastels for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways with which the country perished to be no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious food, such as bread and casserole, became staple foods to reuse casserolle as a" wonderful way to recycle food residues, "as cooks could conceal unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried out, because a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen understanding."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular supplement at lunch," "says Coe."</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics carried out between 1923 and 1943 - such as the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by giving recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housewives "and the challenge of turning Pampe as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland hai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks occur usually only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an examination on board the Sanna research ship, this shark was allowed to return to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland shark runs along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal speed up to 2.6 km / h and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by loneliness, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science, "at least by a Greenland hai, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist assumed for a long time, Greenland-sharks become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only were the evidence missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-pentagons were they, when they held six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the loot make this shark: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers that torpedo from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much Carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"its birth should therefore remain after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a slight surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lenticular nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters, is not accidental."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon-tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should invest rather in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time to the next European pilgrimage to all the ministries in two years, the Oberministrant-General St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"different pilgrimages were tested and one finally decided on the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, the doors of mercy on Freiburg Cathedral were offered a special pilgrim goal."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruene, Haigerloch, and the holy rooms were on their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening, Parish Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and shared the pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb, it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster unseen loving woman is standing and thus the pilgrimage route taken from the Münster cathedral."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner thirsts last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after having stayed in March at the London Championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Hoys retirement created a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close."</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner wagered a Olympic Committee at the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a big part of the transformation that ran into a higher gear to slow down it and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It is a flattering comparison. ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have placed an Olympic Committee on the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at the side Kenny and Hoys, Hinder pointed out that after a weak start he was visibly reduced to the railroad."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later returned this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such problem for such an outstanding victory this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels with the whole GB flags at the tribune as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many surtitles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form Kenny, it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year old Bolton said," I only enjoy this for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the end of 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, who won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be focused on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had fought with officials before the qualification, when he called him functionaries to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition which continues tomorrow and ends, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong web-wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, Dramas played in the background so that the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sexism and mobbingvortices as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like that the now legendary reputation GBs, who has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy yield questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game, since the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus abolishes all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"not less than 2,000 workstations - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could lead to domino effects since the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risk a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting workshop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melt", "the company shared."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" "hedging businesses", "which should have come into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the financial year 17," said the supplier of electricity. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on income on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in the" "anticipation of cancellation". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting or to ensure the power supply to smelting "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into force from November this year, even if there is still one explanation guilty of why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"because of the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn against the potential closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland would consume around 600 MW and Tomago approximately 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, that would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" "break model" "of her generation - falls under the former category, it is in good company."</seg>

<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like success to everyone."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships for our local communities alone, creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will flash on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn in witty growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion investment investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to T2 that was built in the midst of the two most frequented walkways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine whether Venus could have enacted similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus exhibits its day side of the Sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planets explorers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to a great deal of heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt out by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey conducted by the malware protection specialist Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, UK and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malwarebytes to attack on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially lead ransom is much higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malicious programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients could be acute by the loss of patient records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the payload areas and the contact with the blackers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites, or decrypt free sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit totals in order to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware recovery, the hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening you are rolling around for hours, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer thinking about sleeping a long time before the alarm bells."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, says Hans-Günter Weeder, board member of the German Society for Schlafford and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just the sleep feels a lot of people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association, with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind them can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is common, especially when it comes to depression," says Weblast. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are intertwining each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and may possibly start to salute on everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleeping disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment may look quite different: you have been beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there are hardly any vacant sleeping medicine in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, Director of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in case of sleep problems, one should first turn to the atrician, tell us."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for examination in the sleep lab, doctors recommend snoring with respiratory dropouts, in case of sickness-fatigue, sleep transducers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disturbance, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the test.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After ticking one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal cannula, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera on the ceiling distinguishes the sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can affected people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you don't sleep in bed, don't sleep too long in bed, don't watch TV for sleeping, avoid smoking and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that's not at all conducive."</seg>

<seg id="5">"article on this" "trendy neighborhood", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, but in recent weeks it is preferred by burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents now have lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June the premises on the ground floor, the cadtersmiths, were cleared by 300 police officers, police patrol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three clubteam cars on site, locked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers were commissioned by the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers withdrew from the cheering of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others converge ahead of late Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left force is not the main source of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 and Jana *, who draws three children here, mainly from the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wants majority police protection from the fleshocking left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police put up between the landowners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter, which even today compared to the rest of the city a low average income and high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all the Mainzer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under great police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the city of Riga and are partly inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 by new rental companies."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by discarded panes or newly painted facades that were discarded with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that crime is not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury, statistics are reported almost exclusively against police officers."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences make property damage, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in terms of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rīga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Rīga Strait - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that residents get back their street: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the authority over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through historical buildings built in former buildings, which displace old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here are rather people who are not so well-behaved," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction cannot I approve." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should be done if someone never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"on all sides, there is frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="8">"for example, some - less ridiculous than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative trainer with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an insult of Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point of time for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Client, that Annika Deuschle supports honorable and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must submit the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility alternates from the council office to the Commune and the Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, the administration does not find any private dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it didn't work so far, that one is dependent on private apartments, so Deuterle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be carried out as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new containers are installed in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and work-aid activities for refugees and migrants who have to be tiled or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a firm structure, say deuterle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here also administration and community members jump."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you have to explain the refugees that it will take and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problem cases, says customer honestly," people, where nothing goes. "the work of Deuterle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">That is all a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: after the recent incidents, the two have fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no, Regine customer clearly says," "what some naïve call". "however, a residual risk can and may not exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would bring them completely into call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they don't have anything to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So major and volunteers have to look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants to come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach has already begun to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
