Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal struck by Obama on the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the U.S. Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in an emergency call is a professor who has shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb spoke with a somewhat irrit@@ able voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note cut on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who had been in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to school grounds where he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ cies Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal un@@ ob@@ itu@@ ary at some point afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lamb took life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty covers 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy indicate that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not give him a guarantee for an automatic route to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; said Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ik@@ as before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the fr@@ aming and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the Dead Professor , conducted the first semester program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his br@@ otherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Memorial , while the University &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the cry after he had shot Schmidt , and that he called his wife in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plans to set fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 employees have been hired at Christmas 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said it will start with application discussions this month , and the number of employees is rising from October to December . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies prepare to hire temporary workers to fur@@ nish shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also not@@ e@@ worthy for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated g@@ amma and a arm length of it , with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN commander calls again all parties , including the split UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the margin of the meeting of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ban stressed the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper cat@@ ches in p@@ olls , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led the lead to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom did not only win a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps arbit@@ ration values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a pol@@ l conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
only two out of ten say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son can say about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters think that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temperature for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is true in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and say almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their v@@ ows , Repub@@ lican voters keep Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say a pol@@ l by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the four out of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters can watch Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump sums up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ ze and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have for@@ given their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump said in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ed &quot; was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Repub@@ lican party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , det@@ ects around half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , princip@@ ally by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ro@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street one square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special layers one square meter the most costs . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Real Estate Service Provider Engel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros , nothing - per square meter , noted . &quot;
&quot; well , who can afford it ... &quot;
by the way : Munich is not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have brought a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack@@ er ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth star success in series is to be the first step towards Fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; with his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership , Müller received the grac@@ ious help of Olympic Games Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had a f@@ atten@@ ed shot of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm was promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based talking . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without having to shine .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , including the famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went courage@@ ously , however , with their aggressive efforts , however , often too un@@ imagin@@ able to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often introduced by a game shift on the left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , who rarely went through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct tak@@ eover , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria with@@ drew its usual game , Pi@@ raeus could set sof@@ tw@@ ood . &quot;
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was a decree .
&quot; so , for example , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola made a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat at first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , said sports pilot Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made one better . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ allen . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mu@@ til@@ ated Bavaria fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with cl@@ ashes against the Munich fans . &quot;
at least a Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium .
anyone smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that is what makes a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study close . &quot;
&quot; the good news : when zi@@ cht , the risk decreases quickly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; root causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk , however , within a short time , the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained author Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; said Dr. H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our knowledge , also leads to a good tooth health down to the high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arche@@ ologists come across from Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer to lef@@ to@@ vers from the late antique era
for the repeated time on the right Rhine river in Cologne Arch@@ e@@ ological finds have been made .
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historic buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist office for archaeological heritage conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now found five . &quot;
&quot; text documents have already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with some 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman covered by freight train
&quot; after a young woman died at the station in &quot; &quot; Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen &quot; &quot; ( Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern ) , the federal police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the track towards the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it was severely damaged by the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated on the spot and brought to a hospital by rescue personnel .
&quot; on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly cross @-@ border crossing of the young woman , there is no evidence of the medi@@ ating officials . &quot;
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its operation corresponds to significantly more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swedish has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is supposed to develop with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time a second instance is planned .
she would allow it to appeal against judgment .
&quot; until now , the parties involved in the proceedings agreed with each other to the arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their sentences . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; for example , there could also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , on which the companies deny damage to tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national legislation or a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act submitted the Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account key points in the reform of the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned that the charges of the economy are constra@@ ined by too many new rules .
&quot; especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement , the TTIP will remain un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting follow@@ er has recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost moved by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he talks about different places , which he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a banned series : each of the 50 states of the US should be in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans has already appeared and has a positive impact . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the show . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Hu@@ ise &quot; ) , a nationwide celebrated masterpiece will be released in 2005 . &quot;
super@@ imposed on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American b@@ ill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then cat@@ ers to &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic pieces of pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played with programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; since the smaller clubs have gone up long ago , the stage shows are presented here to the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on Fl@@ oral bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark@@ ly held Hamburg More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs here now , the clearly mature st@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings with sus@@ pen@@ se . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six questions shortly after noon and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during the ceremony of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several front pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they called themselves on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ acked &quot; &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow work and r@@ ents minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been a T@@ ory leader over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and given him more than 30.000 inspir@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s findings are too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he is under@@ going both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the battle with anti @-@ hooks and instead endeav@@ oured to focus on serious issues such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of the Econom@@ ist , is represented if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ tion@@ ist . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first sent on television in 1990 , the findings with the Prime Minister were regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Parliament and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and required far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound goes up with accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the B@@ BM@@ iller carrier target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and achieved appreciation at the time of an increase in interest .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed by an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover bid of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - will again grow again .
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore &apos;s shares increased by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by selling stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper corporation Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a fall by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had &quot; sell &quot; his estimate for the company . &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports car company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half .
JD Sports CEO says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labor costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster launches Lebanese on Pot@@ ato B@@ owl idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
&quot; both - and in the Pot@@ ato @-@ öner , developed by Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; potato instead of the twe@@ eter &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at an Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes &quot; &quot; instead of the &quot; &quot; D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally had seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a grill sk@@ ewer which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea of the Lebanese have meanwhile admitted to the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to reveal . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot;
Met@@ a launches ground @-@ breaking campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ ci@@ dents
met@@ cash attempts to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Metal@@ cash has launched a ground tracking campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ a and IG@@ A Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A stores and retail shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investor strategy ag . &quot;
there is a lot in the game because South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profits as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away roughly five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away sales of all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and met@@ a 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; the loss in food and food business , and in the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of high fixed cost base , could cost around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan has found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , reducing the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ a refused to react publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a member of the management board of cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has contacted . &quot;
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operative debt reduction in simultaneous printing on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , pays off and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to align sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week , improving their stores by faster growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programmes are to be determined on ver@@ ve , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have sm@@ ashed Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I was supposed to beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen , how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp broke a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was ste@@ ered by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am rather excited about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost due to a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is focused entirely on the competition and not all the contro@@ versy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight he can only think about , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary accounts for the emergency , and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of migrants arrested in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and responded to Serbian officials with indign@@ ation . &quot;
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land@@ mine on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian government police . &quot;
some reject food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a meeting in Brussels not to agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be concluded that the EU states would receive more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency level , which was ev@@ oked on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even imprisonment in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence made by the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sentences for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , expected next week , but rep@@ or@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen working on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now police @-@ aware and are accused of moving off@@ ences to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are here to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to go there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in getting into it , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey half @-@ time
&quot; the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her across the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by what candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
Clinton has a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
&quot; your support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders here is only 5 points back . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters in the local elections say nation@@ ally that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support it with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate . &quot;
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited above all by her .
the views are strongly mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and vot@@ e@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 per cent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if bi@@ den decides not to run the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage , which sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; , &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the di@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its in the election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is best suited to hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion about him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in general elections typically also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be placed as foreign minister during the term of office , most democr@@ acies of the pri@@ mar@@ ies are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not been influenced overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on the Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinions were wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is viewed hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy by the elec@@ tors of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of voters don &apos;t consider them to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters in the country see Tr@@ ump as well as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good grades for guidance . &quot;
&quot; among the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many do not believe him . &quot;
the fault quote for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two Can@@ did@@ ates , half of the voters support in the new pol@@ l , and others lose a dramatic attack . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
but Car@@ son fired from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ze , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % . &quot;
the fault margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he lands at 19 % support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with regard to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son had ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even though peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a dip in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College no@@ ble@@ men
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ p@@ ous ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people will be filed . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been charged with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ si @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g f@@ ain@@ ted and report@@ edly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , such as the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling its symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said polic@@ eman Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the good of the br@@ otherhood on the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ tel@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the sham@@ an every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in a statement . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with suspic@@ ious attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also take this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase of interest is coming , and the hous@@ se is falling into fuel , yields for bonds are rising , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank emphas@@ ise that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could see that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a zinc increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest savings can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be revers@@ ed from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest caves . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has in the past 35 years mostly in warming - about 14 percent - on the way to the zinc increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , Chief Investment Strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the In@@ cre@@ ase cycle , and the return on this begins to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession . &quot;
remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a zinc increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic cou@@ l@@ isse could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants adopted the F@@ ed interest rate all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the elev@@ ating cycles from 1950 to the present have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months .

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when changing their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a curve of the curve . &quot;
&quot; state loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st near Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones states that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; alongside the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen ; the yield curve is flat , lending arms have expanded and the volati@@ lity is increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and entire business , companies that profit from the greater part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positive three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by aver@@ aging 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar . &quot;
&quot; sa@@ vers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Spe@@ aker Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ c@@ aster for its &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM , claiming a leading member of the Parliament and increases new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC bos@@ ses , that the public law radio station &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director dism@@ issed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that har@@ sh@@ er had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to get to the feet of commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , The Voice , - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; on special BBC . &quot;
&quot; he added , he would like the company to &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; if it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from fee payments for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping was bo@@ oming , and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; overall expendi@@ tures for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sale . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ utes , and we may see that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as one reason for subsequent sales . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers visited their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers web sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the shop@@ pers opposed bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out of £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia is breaking down the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed . &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the slain who were killed when a crane ran to Mek@@ ka &apos;s great mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to at@@ inate their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em C@@ emetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession passed on to the sacred site , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then rus@@ hed onto the praying . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King hung over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane fell by the great Central Mo@@ cha Mek@@ ka , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , was standing as the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the yearly pad@@ dle in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today king Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group said , would not have allowed the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month , gathered . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive building project led by the bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the Saudi Arabia ruling family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased Chief of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a deser@@ ted son who was dischar@@ ged from the family during the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other wounded receive half of this amount .

&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales offices nationwide &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
&quot; if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; because British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the tree @-@ restricted chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , the services offered at low prices , is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight of ten purchase decisions in store are met by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the employees out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about purchasing articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of just five women at the top of a UK leader in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also outlined their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial performance . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turno@@ vers after the group sh@@ ook the costs of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Vice @-@ Vice President A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dism@@ iss@@ als . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of office abuse .
&quot; in May , he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in force . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the defend@@ ants had funds from association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial loss .
&quot; this fact retired the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association had not ar@@ isen at any time an asset . &quot;
&quot; sports function@@ aries would have only charged up @-@ to @-@ date compensation and have invested the sports club for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Euro in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; , &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the Brot@@ vocation , told large @-@ scale inspec@@ tors of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have sur@@ passed money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the tak@@ eover . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of financial success , the withdrawal of the compensation claims had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one has paid off some of the remun@@ er@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was paid on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , package deals and not detail bookings seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for the financial settlement , but it was important not to have the debt freedom , so the answer was . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigation of office abuse , an amount of 1@@ 20.000 Euro was transferred to the Club &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; those were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted the judge to know . &quot;
wher@@ eup@@ on the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time .
&quot; then he finally said , he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ aries justified themselves . &quot;
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant said that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never pays a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
detailed documentation for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
&quot; these were after an operating test where everything was judged correctly , no longer kept , they declared . &quot;
kilomet@@ er@@ entry was also related to the second accused .
&quot; all accommodation is in cash , and he has to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , and he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard sets another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the ongoing personnel reduction for three years , the computer giant will be able to reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions for the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology company plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate accounts . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around € 2.7 billion , which will drop as of the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP currently employs roughly 300,000 people at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which is grown with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : in this way , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the future @-@ proof areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a further dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer continued to rely on Lenovo &apos;s second @-@ largest PC maker . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP respon@@ ds with a split and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more shops online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan envis@@ ages the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 points . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be predominantly against rejection : 54 percent said against it , 35 percent were indic@@ ative . &quot;
&quot; that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , 24 percent are involved in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with Syrian rulers Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents would refuse to be 20 percent . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have been deployed to the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and wat@@ chers against several hundred raised refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees under@@ went the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the police there was a floo@@ d@@ light ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to officials . &quot;
&quot; first , the officials stopped pep@@ per@@ spray . &quot;
then the police used tear gas .
many tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn something back .
a pregnant and apparently wounded woman was taken away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot;
other refugees came together and suffered severe difficulties .
the press spokes@@ men of the Ser@@ b police also suffered injuries because of the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global relations . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances for such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death Con@@ tac@@ ting at the Delta State University leaves us excuse
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day and killed - wrote Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb a note to say that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could do it wrong , &quot; &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer of geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency center , that the police had to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house but nobody will b@@ other , but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday night when police enc@@ ir@@ cled him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who proclaimed that they were married for about seven years than a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; Lamb have ph@@ oned relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up at Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb took his car aside , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb was awarded a doc@@ torate in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University as his life was on the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their luck charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against Leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot trade union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
&quot; Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure , evaluating the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; the objective of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger &apos;s business in the future . &quot;
&quot; for this , the low cost line Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible . &quot;
&quot; in the management board around Chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ aud will in future be responsible for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual revenue of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with pilots
&quot; in Tari@@ ff conflict with the cock@@ pit pilot association ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the Stri@@ ke Stri@@ ke . &quot;
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record result , &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; will come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the provision of the pilot , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; austerity concept . &quot;
it is fores@@ ee@@ able that Lufthansa will reloc@@ ate to the company &apos;s own Bil@@ li@@ gl@@ inie Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat in Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this brought the left outer def@@ ender to we@@ ep and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
&quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double bone structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later , and then operated in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it will take six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had gone ast@@ ray .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card are due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V defeat
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost out@@ war@@ dly . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because there seems to always be a picture or message that we missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron report@@ edly describes the plot of the book , re@@ prints a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not yet be suspic@@ ious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of the need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , hears from the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , whis@@ ky creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR role was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ son &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it &apos;s still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not finish an out@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks section may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali turns out to be a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ es from the UK test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I &apos;ve said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , it would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but it had control of its own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arrives . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test kick @-@ man gets to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer , whom I greatly appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer , what we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends of course on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , di@@ ved , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ and has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s l from cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before joining in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately made three hundred laps and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of back@@ ups that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and power@@ fully into the setup .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ paid ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely damaged due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at once said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always made up of their own fault , Britain &apos;s self created agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing treaty changes that they mostly do not want to be att . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European boy@@ friend , who wants a UK @-@ based UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long au@@ ras like thu@@ gs ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; so maybe some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects mine friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press area , as it did during the 1975 @-@ inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the ore Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU bar@@ ade ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; in all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who have most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually , Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but realized that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one better ban@@ anas be distributed to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ son &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had set the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never for@@ given him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on the back of Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to waste more for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ th anniversary , an error back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s official position on Europe is - I really express it - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wild war@@ riors of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; keep &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow soldier and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on her exam on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the ag@@ it@@ ous bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of all things in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech @-@ dum@@ pling campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin be w@@ asting political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday , what British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded Agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he published the &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alleg@@ ations &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants told the meeting to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which include a sector finance in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes could serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted earlier . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for placing public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ disp@@ uted time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ itters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success trying to come into contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
&quot; I would like to see myself , as this should be public broad@@ cast@@ ed television . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ enders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal &quot; &quot; BB@@ C4 &quot; &quot; programs should go where they can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue that if they refer to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds , &quot; &quot; well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think everyone thinks that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , wonder if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; inform , train and maintain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should &quot; &quot; inform , inform and talk about the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown , and with the commercial stations alli@@ ances go down to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane @-@ channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
read more about this topic : scientists read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani states that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ als and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms to carry some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one &apos;s TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ als . &quot;
&quot; when it turns ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent to the desired location in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the cited human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; important notice : travel from September 15th to 18th with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prev@@ ailed around the advertising for the tru@@ ce fair - through a le@@ ak of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago , I as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ter 19 @-@ year @-@ old moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have been angry - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry in student residen@@ ces extends from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sk@@ inn@@ y : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ y , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest , Mar@@ m@@ ite does not love or hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extra@@ kt H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were fire and these extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into beverages @-@ recep@@ tions , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and their under@@ wear . &quot;
related : do not remember to start with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bubble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking . &quot;
&quot; speaking of speaking , do it . &quot;
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighbourhood , I gave you something baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an an@@ ual bakery . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep dor@@ man@@ t when kno@@ cking . &quot;
steal food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my ro@@ ommate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the saying belongs to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it &apos;s something to make them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move to the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a co @-@ resident for your future spouse , to go to them again and see them every day and perhaps experience how to move all together friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good place is fun , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never fail one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not tor@@ ch their poss@@ essions on the ceiling not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; row houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , ger@@ min@@ ers &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building in the Francon@@ ian corner @-@ valley town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; so , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and grow good today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : it builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass of containers in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ d : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you teach people in blocks of residence .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily changed according to the individual needs .
how much are the costs ?
&quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building instructions complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; guil@@ d : yes , I have learned my project correctly . &quot;
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ hi@@ ft special construction and the plac@@ eholders &quot; ordin@@ ance . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a terrac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is the place lacking .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
&quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do not ti@@ ghten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries : true is : we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ative mother or the nurse . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build and grow good today .
that &apos;s what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by locking the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off half way , and this could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the update . &quot;

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searches for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the retirement center Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the clo@@ ak of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; not often many services of the insur@@ ers are not used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training , or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , manager of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center will see both executives , particularly in demographic change . &quot;
&quot; for this , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure is essential in the individual city districts of Bamberg in the future . &quot;
&quot; besides , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association with the old : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

men test on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11.@@ 45 pm , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to be waiting for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man , and struck him with his fist . &quot;
&quot; the victim suffered a nos@@ eb@@ and , bleeding heavily from the nose . &quot;
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured was in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the bat and another male .
&quot; with the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel .
&quot; furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a restructuring phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then , he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the rim exhibition met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing her specialist education in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage men would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I simply ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss soon . &quot;
and so one agreed that the gar@@ bage men bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they are still living in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the double family father Frank Müller also grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunte@@ ered in the DR@@ K @-@ prepar@@ edness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19th , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sten@@ berg works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle as a house doctor . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ free EK@@ EN@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ P is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50,000 euros will be donated to the gar@@ bage collector as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the District ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; says Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come to practice in the field of rock breaks . in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
&quot; in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is another medical practice . &quot;
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel fields in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk hour , by the way , also looks especially in familiar faces : he takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical professionals have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel is reminiscent of rock breaks . &quot;
&quot; after the long time , she already felt a little melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients often , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds smiling : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed myself from gardening , now it could become different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also carried up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit a asylum application can &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; do so . &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; however , it is clear also that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to travel on incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; this is how the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look at Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not want to dis@@ appro@@ ve of its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fill in its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in eastern Croatia to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , there have been police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country will deal with some 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , in accordance with Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it would be the people to adver@@ tise certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it was . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers had been travelling the whole night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away by Serbia .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it could actually come to a slightly further west @-@ east route to ob@@ servers that have already predicted the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot;
perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since been consistently witn@@ essing a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining refugees will now travel to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local presence in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be about very high numbers of refugees at this time .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared mines for 20 years after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which is accused of having gained insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der shops should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; thus , according to the investig@@ ators , more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders are ultimately tr@@ apped , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot;
the trials against 32 more accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants were taken from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are to have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim for 20 years
around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is an active operation .
&quot; people do their concerns , sometimes fast p@@ acing , partly cozy bum@@ med . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
city rail@@ ways keep .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle four large boards each with the title &quot; &quot; Before I want to die ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid pointed out with this action to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the voluntary workers .
&quot; while some fits spontan@@ eously to the chal@@ k and read the sentence for &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; you can &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world is coming , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian Plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ best@@ federation of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to share publicly on the tables , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the topic of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people . &quot;
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral and mour@@ ning attend@@ ant is part of the volunteer staff of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid was looking for volunteers , she immediately reported to me and was there in 1995 when it was founded . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent . &quot;
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her tasks and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ p , consider it precious and precious the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and clubs allows the training as well as training and super@@ vis@@ ing of the dying and funeral directors .
trainings for new employees are offered every two years .
&quot; the plates on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , further personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the manufacturer Gig@@ ant lowered his outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. spoke to earn a $ 10,@@ 40 $ and € 10@@ ,90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next month , 20 c@@ ents less than with earlier pre@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower prospect will result in spite of the price increases , which amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and , in spite of the higher sur@@ charges for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;

&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; delivers solid income if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday occupation were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share came to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predic@@ ting the analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion US $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on the most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ ag@@ onian table in order to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seating area is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented interest rates since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is sound solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could be anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which prohi@@ bits the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , showing only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average value was 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that an increase of interest would ease the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good way to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level that F@@ ed regards as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can master higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered at the end of last month after China with@@ drew its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would crum@@ ble global growth . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in the decision making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , dis@@ sol@@ ves conf@@ usions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; his decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements which , apparently , are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ates for an increase of interest , has opted for decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limiting noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts und@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a serious crisis , such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase of interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds twice the mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should advance the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co , and is a Thai wholesale market which also sells to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and c@@ rock@@ ery , furniture , religious jewellery and Christmas decorations . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still teaching with her 74 lec@@ tions .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at Dill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande supports diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to inform women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics building at the Bern@@ ese sports ground step by step : in the latest community meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the committee had , among other things , decided to apply for a &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special shape in relation to the roof structure . &quot;
&quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ry first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; through this we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger stated in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , the roof incl@@ ine , which for energetic reasons , was not required - differently than in the cultivation plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the slope does not permit exceptions , whereby the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council is generally more restri@@ ctive when it comes to eman@@ cipation . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project for gymn@@ as@@ tics : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter hall will be presented to the Federal Council for Testing . &quot;
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this is the supervisory board , and the postpon@@ ement of the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; since the beginning of the beginning , Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the beginning , has now moved to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; fishermen &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 , and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; upgra@@ ding &quot; &quot; and a spread of the range in the &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; range , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
f@@ isher is a specialist in p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to appro@@ ve both houses , until next year the former hospital of the boy , which still has more than 35 beds , is to be closed finally in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment was completed at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; Fresh@@ fields Bruck@@ haus Der@@ inger Firm of the Year for In@@ solv@@ ency Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz Firm of the Year for White C@@ ollar Crime Rede@@ ker Sell@@ ner D@@ ahs
&quot; I conclude that . as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ bed psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; says f@@ isher about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure over the past few decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions today is called on the Berg@@ ischer HC in the evening ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the s@@ wimm@@ ers in the B@@ HC have suffered a painful defeat and have made a little dirty there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the ab@@ err@@ ation on a corn@@ field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were used , as the police said . &quot;
&quot; after a shooting , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly this happened to the accident , was un@@ clear . &quot;
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Police ) was established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to the young people and cast their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence . &quot;
&quot; the young woman &apos;s cor@@ p@@ se was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , as well as an investig@@ ator , is considered to be active in the Tuesday evening , which report@@ edly conf@@ essed the indication and lead the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after she did not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; when searching for a young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the sei@@ z@@ ure was reported to the police , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the o@@ at on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put it to death . &quot;
the investigation of the near@@ er circumstances of the act shall bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ aler Housing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many will then drive onto the housing market and join in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany reloc@@ ates an apartment deficit , which is increasing from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there were around 77@@ 0,000 residential units in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel M@@ om &quot; &quot; because of the ke@@ epers on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has declined for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the basic income tax could be wai@@ ved and the corn@@ erst@@ ones for subsi@@ dis@@ ed homes may be subject to a limited period of time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Cl@@ an . &quot;
the Aid Programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; on Monday evening , a good week after the launch of 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros has been rec@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia establish corridor
&quot; in Hungary there is practically no transit anymore , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if it is necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary included its border to refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically render proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across the border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border stri@@ pe threat@@ ens other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers should quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any refugees . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 rap@@ tured people . &quot;
shortly before the gate on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border zone as criminal off@@ ense .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
sentenced to five years in prison and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were met on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sed@@ ans &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , no one has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they gathered the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barrier gri@@ ds were disman@@ tled and one of the recor@@ ders in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to speak about the aim of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; but the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government officials . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities . &quot;
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the end of the bridge on Sunday , when suddenly ten people with travel ministers stood at the entrance to the tent , &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
&quot; because Germany was surprisingly busy on Sunday but because of the influ@@ x of refugees with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his assistance and put the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we had ta@@ sted the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with lunch and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers had changed from a ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was stopped at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing generally is high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ festival was soci@@ able with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , day before a second bridge , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends another z@@ ig@@ ma to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp to help build structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially publicly and publicly tra@@ ded the position of the Hungarian government in the ha@@ vo@@ c of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also find that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood streams and the coming winter , in order to produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 winter fixed quarters
&quot; with the relief of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was also carried out without a great host , &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ y . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke about a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ry in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the local govern@@ ors .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create quarters for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ s have to hold a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a time @-@ limited period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; Konrad is based on his experience , in contrast to the Interior Ministry when he was accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause costs , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
&quot; so far , the search for its own districts was not yet successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; first , no opening of city sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees plans the city of Linz . &quot;
mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says that this is not necessary at the moment .
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; according to the Council of Ministers , the Gover@@ nor General of the Council of the Council of the Council of the Council of the Council of the European Union . &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a lengthy telephone call with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor of State Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has taken over the further procedure in the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
seal has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
it is still possible to continue travelling from refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany .
&quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for stronger solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria now carries out checks again at its borders is &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially closed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in Start@@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard , and later that too . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; D wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; over 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the total 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ or opened second shop in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ ress of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad : after all , she has now received growth in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the business in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , all around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot;
&quot; previously , several weeks have been modified . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered if I should still open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the metropol@@ itan Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; for me most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women , when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , can &apos;t be answered with the last safety . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is valued .
the T@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ up .
&quot; whether it is hostile to foreign journalists , journalists sc@@ amm@@ ers or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stimul@@ ates the election campaign strongly . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate have come from milli@@ on@@ aires . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dres@@ ser is a term many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related over -@@ sixty corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native town of K@@ all@@ stadt has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the hearts , he did not bring it there . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big mouth &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ gi@@ ver , she says . &quot;
&quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ ders . &quot;
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company was first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; however , the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland long ago failed in the Bavarian state , to which the at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once min@@ ed without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked say@@ ings of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly accused of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; such as the Pole is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ vort@@ ex Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they would find it better if he did not wi@@ pe the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ singers , also in the USA w@@ akes interest . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria town of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; ) may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
the breakfast show by N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the Moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the item seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in recent months Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these dawn more than Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics have wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck lightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e resulted in 44@@ 6,000 viewers . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour there was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will finally prevail at 5 : 30@@ pm .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor of Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally lands at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before from three two , you may acci@@ dentally have acci@@ dentally given a hint about who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have retired ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game spoil will become who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both knew quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and realized ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are suitable as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house @-@ visit made it clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30@@ h . &quot;
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a tie , as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League @-@ conver@@ ti@@ t did on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the match .
&quot; instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his embarrass@@ ed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian company had hoped for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; after the F@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ ne vac@@ ated the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not introduce himself to his N@@ FL career . &quot;
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his orig@@ ine debut in 2007 when a pass led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

&quot; due to the high refugee figures , free voters are calling for the setting up of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn clause in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools before collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get irrit@@ ation in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Friday @-@ election of Free voters is postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Frank@@ ish Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as they did during the Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum applications : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards in federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the regional policy should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt . &quot;
a long @-@ term tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , cult minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has launched the pilot project &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; at 47 high schools , where an extension of the secondary school was tested from three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ bling does not go far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
solid Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
&quot; after a long distance , the German stock market has closed the trend of loos@@ ening and nervous trading with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a firm opening of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X average value was 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the tech @-@ elastic Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
&quot; Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 , as the euro@@ zone &apos;s index , dropped by about 0.@@ 01 per cent to 320@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also bu@@ ked trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in this way , many Bör@@ Si@@ tians expect the markets to take place until after the interest decision in the US and also for the major decline in the date markets on this Friday . &quot;
the debate about the bur@@ dens from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and also left deep traces on E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.9 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax @-@ tip .
&quot; according to a retail@@ er , a positive report from the US magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; had an effect on the weekend . &quot;

4 killed by police officers shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot rubber floors into a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used tear gas and fired into the air , before it res@@ orted to rubber bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; twenty @-@ five polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known from which is known , can kill them , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last week of violent protests in Nepal in southern states where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ ish@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent con@@ front@@ ations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which had been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature has voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of 4000 square meters of space .
&quot; a mixture of trade , business and living - concrete offers are not yet planned . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , business and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
the investor &apos;s question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts had yet been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner big street , just a few months ago , and the buildings on it were torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the cottage settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some tra@@ ilers are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure area .
&quot; months behind closed doors had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new cottage settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; the interested party , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends from the system @-@ building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
&quot; violent reactions among marine owners , who had come to the meeting , emphasized the pictures and new details about the requested hotel construction . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea , and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ z which over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : &quot; &quot; all bus loads must come so that that &apos;s worth it , &quot; &quot; said Mr Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening exactly on the one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a conclusi@@ ve concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling Don@@ ations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign , which aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organisations to help the thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of giving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences with her family . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to google.com / refuge@@ es@@ el@@ ief , to 11 million $ . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has exp@@ elled more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many flee from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya torn from the war . &quot;
report of Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to shrink the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
&quot; over the years , obesity has been effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body @-@ mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ sing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those under@@ going this operation declined from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes care approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those under@@ going a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes cases dissolved completely and at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , the diabetes completely dissolved only in one percent , and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood level , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , so the leader researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also provides average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ ot@@ omy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 versus 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not have an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have tied up their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently being increased in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , hits the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is delighted that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader demanded to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the US violent reaction drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which are strongly alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years reported , reported from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how you@@ thful dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth water to get a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in inf@@ ants a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hands @-@ on inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold that is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; There are no Belgi@@ ans to speak of - just the three peoples of Belgium agre@@ eing that they don &apos;t hate each other enough to form separate states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl fell through the alcohol and had stum@@ bled across the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ on inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing san@@ iti@@ zation agents containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a mort@@ al solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth grade planned in New York State to poison their &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to san@@ iti@@ zer and banned them from their room .
&quot; the police regarded the wart@@ ed plan as a &quot; &quot; gun &quot; &quot; and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

&quot; in the accident @-@ related vehicles , impair@@ ment of about 10,000 euros was generated , shares the police . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontan@@ eously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under elevated control , as they prepare themselves for the confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at present , de Bo@@ er , an Ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show any highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic fought , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man Aber@@ deen , who now stand at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it exactly like that - but we need to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team who won everything , in Po@@ kal@@ play or Li@@ es , who won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it asc@@ ends altogether . &quot;
&quot; the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 per cent , as figures from the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation stone for stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I become a witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison control . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day approached , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see Hin@@ ts in the USA , and there are often more applications available than places available , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I cannot do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to record a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I am compl@@ aining with her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I think there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ or@@ ters to whom you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after firing squ@@ ash @-@ ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he was talking about the man of Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters from a police officer , trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the Police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about doing his uniform , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ able . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that &quot; &quot; ste@@ wards &quot; &quot; by Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive Cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ shot at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age charges , and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously Moo@@ dy had made the bomb explo@@ ded in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity @-@ department was trying to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name if I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should this be the opinion that it becomes personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L manage to behave and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take me my license and viol@@ ate myself , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the Black C@@ avi@@ ar Master , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horses &apos; debate , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was so on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
man acc@@ urs@@ ed to driver &apos;s cur@@ sed
the police arrested a man on the weekend after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and a driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway . &quot;
&quot; the police said , the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia of the police came to Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver &apos;s cur@@ sed and in@@ filtr@@ ated assistance and for other traffic crimes .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring struggling
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called cri@@ tique of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm gam@@ ers &quot; ring races &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised comment to the Storm @-@ Team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ p of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him a confident voice , as it proved that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it always appears again and again - I have not heard Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring battles , when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has been the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like them . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to the big games . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters was a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos , against cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and don &apos;t score anything exciting ?
for me it is the playing plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on next morning . &quot;
&quot; beer beer with $ 200,000 deposit on drug charges &quot;
&quot; a man who may have a life @-@ long punishment , because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and set up in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial lot of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been of a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to get his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ able statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to stop him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he det@@ ects his Australian and Ser@@ b passport , det@@ ained at the police every day and kept at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 in Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , just as the police said . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing operator was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure a ped@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , took part in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hand of the dor@@ man@@ t H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ erts instantly her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web searches , &quot; &quot; the search for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; then H@@ og@@ g said to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; &quot; and he then pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
after his talks he was asked with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant Computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the Indi@@ c@@ tment to have in@@ decent pictures taken by children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January this year and did not appear before court to attend a hearing on March 24 of this year . &quot;
&quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; no up@@ lifting sexual element &quot; &quot; is found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to get background reports about social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of the judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad users turn to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken off from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers left people increasingly on smaller cross @-@ border cross@@ ings from fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ubs to the German side .
&quot; there , they are received by federal polic@@ emen and for@@ warded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; at the Munich central railway station , there were again clearly more refugees in comparison to the weekly market on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at 8.00 a.m. only 700 people had arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
Stuttgart : dri@@ er of Trop@@ ic Tower &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm br@@ es in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area on Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake District with goats from 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again and again . &quot;
the masses make it : every two years the high@@ s show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
&quot; in 2015 , there is mainly movement among the compact cars that are currently particularly well sold . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accoun@@ ted for by the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; among all the futur@@ istic concepts and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
the Opel Astra is one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automotive industry in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel has a footh@@ old among the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse also offer other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are also included . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra &apos;s competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a fifth in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : totally new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan pick@@ up wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti features its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in addition , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with petrol engines , among them a newly developed 1,0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 b@@ hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
outside the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand on the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
&quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the refurbished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary of the Te@@ gel , which was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners basically claim financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were incar@@ cer@@ ated only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was again on free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office owing to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the constitutional judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for the re @-@ examination . &quot;
you see the human dignity of the man hurt .
Baker &amp; Mc@@ K@@ enz@@ ie Firm of the Year for Banking and Finance
&quot; although legal reasons were only a few days of imprisonment for compensation , a compensation claim was given , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ als must now clarify the height of the monetary compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; so they said , in April , a prisoner of damage , because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , human @-@ un@@ worthy is also the multi@@ task assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had concluded a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel fall in November 2009 . &quot;
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been head@@ lines for missing personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore locked up again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fights , it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of junior staff , 19 shall be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of Finance , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decis@@ i@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; but the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all in case of affordable rental properties : between 600@@ 00 and 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the rent for rent , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that of the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , scientists and federal government officials agree that there will also be more tax benefits to invest in housing . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically required for their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; it is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers are limited to one place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in the society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , the perspective has prev@@ ailed that refugees should be enabled faster access to the labour market . &quot;
a large barrier to access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the construction of networks is the pinn@@ acle of work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sto@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ bills in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase dramatically due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase education capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge classes in classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ands from the Berlin School of School . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or pati@@ ently prohibited the course of studies - the only exception was Berlin , the interior sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a shelter or dung , do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er law more if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter does not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; for four years , toler@@ ated refugees had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also this funding gap has to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely swe@@ ep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare organization , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner . &quot;
duties are also part of the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it some control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; although Germany , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general gender equality law for a short decade . &quot;
&quot; however , it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been demanding and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years , when the country shall remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as regards man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers at the registration of health cards . &quot;
the services rendered could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to travel as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , doctors are especially making language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be more informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it challenges them . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general emergency clinics in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among the refugees , for instance , there are clearly more non @-@ traff@@ ick@@ ed disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially different illnesses of the disease , German doctors come from her education , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly lay tests again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Medical Psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; in particular , refugee children are vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traum@@ ati@@ sed in Germany .
&quot; anyone who is suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms to be chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill seek@@ ers in the social offices can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy , the processing usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , property workers or doctors , who are not trained for the mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick @-@ was@@ en to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Animal Teacher and Juni@@ or@@ orch@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of the Man@@ hood .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift to spiritu@@ alism is therefore the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday life and take them to a totally different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with world @-@ city flair &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films the Cuban duo wants to loose .
&quot; light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot;
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
&quot; except through numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst impres@@ ses with dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ in@@ iness . &quot;

for He Yu@@ an no problem .
sn@@ ak@@ es@@ men fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks as well : &quot; &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five continents enjoy each match .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes upon the possibility of every desire . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
&quot; so , the upper@@ most Command@@ ment is good for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are there with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , the prices are reduced by 5 pm . &quot;
&quot; in addition , daily the veter@@ an exhibition is open from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of dep@@ u@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to esc@@ ort Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
&quot; last month , they had boo@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , who warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the boss said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 work@@ places as part of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will be split into two listed companies this year , and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job breakdown leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and profound portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ ri@@ cher , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a company statement . &quot;
&quot; it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard for producing electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley &quot; . &quot; &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to cope with the departure of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger said to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , his involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ as in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries sustained during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have an acci@@ dental period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ us@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 matches after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3,@@ 2 measured on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by the far hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ o@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never happened at ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now even more desperate as ever before , how self @-@ mor@@ als among young men prove to be on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced the year of the man to question the culture that hin@@ ders men from seeking help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; an up @-@ to @-@ date study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even when in reality the insulation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during the soccer game in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely refer to it , even though they are often rel@@ uc@@ tant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as one employee of the telephone @-@ pastoral care told me : &quot; &quot; my role for listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and vulnerable , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much as my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the fully re@@ designed setting to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to break Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move past Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince &apos;s Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master along the way , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani made a head@@ ball@@ point in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Chess@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents &apos; problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to achieve in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 deci@@ de@@ dly in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian butter@@ fly was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he entered the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö Defense , he finished beautifully in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; at An@@ pi@@ ff , Malm@@ ö , hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , entered the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tr@@ apps post in the 3@@ 4. minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ understand@@ ings and bad agreements , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had p@@ atz@@ in alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had set him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ates into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal was finally shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er scored his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and in the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level . &quot;
qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ ac@@ ore accum@@ ulates 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; the mining giant of Gl@@ enc@@ ore , resident in Switzerland , who is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion US $ through stock sales as part of its huge debt rep@@ ay@@ ment plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that new shares sold worth approximately 1.6 billion £ in order to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses the demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issu@@ ance of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share grew by 2.@@ 77 percent to EUR 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore announced the 2.5 billion $ stock sales last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to exter@@ minate around one third of its 30 billion USD debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,3 billion shares worth up to 9,@@ 99 per cent of the group . &quot;
&quot; in terms of long @-@ term growth in China , iron ore prices have declined by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; on Tuesday morning , 49 people after a usually long run reach the city administration in Weimar . &quot;
&quot; the refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , practice first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and re@@ affir@@ ms President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan , after the two leaders have bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit first announced in February , is expected to arrive in Seattle several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;

440 @-@ PS sport@@ sc@@ ars borrow@@ ed and driven to scrap
a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to meet a dream and borrow@@ ed a Ford Must@@ ang .
on the wet highway then came the evil awakening .
&quot; with a company in the district Got@@ ha , one can meet the dream and run a V8 American sports car Ford Must@@ ang Boss 302 with 440 hp . &quot;
this was a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the Got@@ ha district .
on the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt the dream was then over and over .
&quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , got into the sk@@ id on wet road@@ way and drove into the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; the sports car suffered a total damage , nobody was injured . &quot;
&quot; the property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000 . &quot;
X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola blocked 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern obviously faced a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three champion Champions , four times champion Champions , two times European champion , two times European champion , a world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he already stood before the European Cup before the European Championship .
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything at that time , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and this also recorded the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi declares , why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ ern@@ ames would have run 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bayern across the entire distance on the lawn , the Red Cross out@@ dated ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s class triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she won &apos;t be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want people to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white hal@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that &quot; &quot; in the end , her direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against mis@@ conception about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WHITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to face discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content . &quot;
in February the singer Prince played a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , also albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation , or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowned first champion
&quot; professional sport clim@@ bers and assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge quickly , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would have felt the same , if they would have sli@@ pped the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an A@@ ged Season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins w@@ asted a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all the victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad P@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit was once three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year heavily , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of any game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the nomin@@ ee tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two races , his first races since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ star hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the heart@@ wood , &quot; &quot; said mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three laps in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to return to the game again . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a bun@@ ny , and Simon took his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before replacing them with the lef@@ th@@ and Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who caught a Two @-@ Run in front of the right @-@ h@@ ander of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time this season in the Major League , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; when Detroit added a Insurance run at the end of the ninth downtown , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ anders , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an un@@ event@@ ful Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three laps in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he was missing more than a month due to a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I have wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I set off and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; in the second one , the tig@@ ers laid out a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three races with six hits and a walk with four ropes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder rig , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he was missing from the 20th of August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees will be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people arriving in them should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden set out on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital had been prepared for this fall in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , the government pres@@ idency of G@@ ießen envis@@ aged 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse . &quot;
&quot; due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls . &quot;
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he rejected the European states &quot; Collec@@ tive Direc@@ tion . &quot;
four years ago one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is landing on our door@@ step , &quot; he said at Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for the refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister for the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back . &quot;
even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mr. Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out interviews on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit next week . &quot;
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial absorption and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , fight this too . &quot;
&quot; but those who have no prospects , could not remain in Germany either . &quot;
this view was strongly divided in the lap .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; enormous effort of force &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees meanwhile are stuck on the Balkans .
&quot; on Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie down the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asion over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately den@@ ounced the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
below the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ aps a global ocean .
&quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its way around the Ring Plan@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; although this de@@ af movement is only small , but too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; already longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the du@@ vet of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered iron volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ ite , the water vap@@ or and ice particles , thereby feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , and the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama lacks 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s Lion , the diagnosis is expected to mean four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ etic loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible commitment of a non @-@ compliant professional . &quot;
&quot; as a train@@ ee , the six@@ ties initially presented a Def@@ en@@ siv@@ ly . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot;
Tor@@ jäger Ruby Ok@@ ot@@ ie may return to the team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent coll@@ ision at the head .
&quot; however , contrary to the first fears he remained without a serious bladder . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gan@@ ese contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
man@@ gan@@ ese contain relatively much sugar - mainly sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. All above all Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too tight and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste very tasty .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ lets like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; for Christmas business in the United States , the U@@ PS parcel service will once again provide up to 95@@ ,000 credits . &quot;
&quot; the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming on @-@ line business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex since last year had earlier arrangements to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first F@@ öh@@ n@@ sturm , then distinctive cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öh@@ n , Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland hur@@ ried on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n partly blows with storm strength through the F@@ öh@@ nt@@ valleys .
&quot; following F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a prominent cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decrease . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland currently stands on the front of an extensive low pressure range on the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ western current . &quot;
on the north side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday the fo@@ ehn .
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the trou@@ ghs to Thursday morning and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can advance through to the adjacent center of Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains are even or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the Alps . &quot;
&quot; here is raining , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , the Alps will have to be calculated in the next 48 hours with partially over 100 litres of rain per square meter , this has already fallen into large amounts of rainf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow comes out , in a row a cold front sp@@ rolls with powerful , partially cloudy rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures go down considerably . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the North with 15 to 20 degrees , on the other hand it becomes sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome has now a Martin Luther place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , an un@@ named place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino on the name of the German Re@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the work community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place will be revealed in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) found himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he received the city as a comm@@ iss@@ ful sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions might have reinforced him from historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ ov@@ arian trade .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus , with the golden crown of the crown , is one of the major works of Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 subjects expressed his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has survived the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; Book of All Books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles resulting from topics such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has spontan@@ eously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into contemporary contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical version of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formulated his personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewellery band has golden letters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggered by the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened once with the cane &quot; , &quot; that Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to bring myself back to the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art again in a fast @-@ p@@ aced time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers fall into the pictures , let them work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to completely capture the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
&quot; plans made , place found , company mand@@ ated to model Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a round course : a year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured dec@@ ency , especially among the residents who did not want the rail@@ road to toler@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; so hill shiel@@ ded , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building approval . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the First Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the kinder@@ garten and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; break @-@ off &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is making a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems associated with it .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must place the policy .
&quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; four years . &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ sbach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal parliam@@ ents also support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs will be showing a clear sign if they are on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeves instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship @-@ logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football teams , no , we need to use our bl@@ asting power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on this Friday . &quot;
Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; a great community network of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all the 36 Lic@@ enses had started their own projects , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we have spent will be lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Nier@@ sbach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP executive board loses an eye when an accident occurs
&quot; the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out onto the road - he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is busy at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , which will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; important is to get up again , if you like . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren Complete pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as a spare main@@ tainer in Singapore on weekends as a spare main@@ tainer for the two stam@@ mer@@ es Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : far@@ ther in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken up . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 07.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
thus he announced a change in the go@@ al@@ keeper position .
that &apos;s why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether pasture plat@@ ter is used in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; speaking of fellow players Re@@ us that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l considers : &quot; that is not that wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robotic car : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the fair IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives from the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategic paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast increase in digital radio communication . &quot;
&quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for instance , Germany wants to deplo@@ y around internationally that the per@@ missible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; on automated driving , the car increases the leadership , the driver becomes more and more passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads are not expected until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the Germans are still scep@@ tical about their self @-@ driving cars - much more than Fr@@ ench@@ men or Americans .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title battle from September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf will only be able to beat up in singles . &quot;
the final decision shall be due at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; said Ms Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the set@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; this is what we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; explained the world rank@@ ings five . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; at the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the def@@ ender was hit by a tac@@ kling of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax lemon cab@@ aret : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequ@@ ins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; formerly it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initial attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just fine clothes , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the oeu@@ vre of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograp@@ hed overall art@@ works for which a lot of effort was taken : to revit@@ alize the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , 14 tons of material have spar@@ ked Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather @-@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers Old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the disc@@ arding of fashion .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought them but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vies Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stil@@ ts , picture an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t use any niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they are already doing half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ haw@@ k Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
there are almost no private stores and wholes@@ alers .
our products do not reach the customer in this way any more .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ ware is much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost exclusively driven by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , currently according to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dered bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used .
&quot; master @-@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Office of the West @-@ Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter animated the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ ches little ch@@ icks in some places . &quot;
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ß was inspired : &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t do anything with the traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; they also deliver to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ auen and surroundings and who want a souvenir . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney appe@@ aled to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a re @-@ movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic kid @-@ girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; but the director is already strong : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy has to open wider out@@ ward to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new spin and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list for regul@@ ating market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local regulatory system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it provides the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legally @-@ state business environment and creating the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen control of the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , open @-@ minded sectors open , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the lawyers &apos; right to practise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also participated in the meeting as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury boundary value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and allow consumers to take a significantly higher dose of nerve tox@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding paper on the EU , has sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; big pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this attrac@@ tiveness , according to Food@@ watch , the EU wants to ti@@ ghten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; however , Food@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of small fish is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action maneu@@ ver , which helps alone the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a highly toxic heavy metal used for humans to accum@@ ulate above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the federal government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; even small amounts can be caused especially in un@@ born damages of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable limits , however , that a &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury gets into the environment mainly through coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants met Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock , more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; had been cited in March from paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings before mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU War@@ ning System RA@@ SF@@ F . &quot;
