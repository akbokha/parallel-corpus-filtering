Obama Recei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlements and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly as aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , but a meeting had been rejected with regard to the election of the election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend shot dead &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was dressed on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by the police after the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tk@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b has done the fatal emergency call some@@ time later .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life , when the police raid him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the details were published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were glad about his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; in his book , Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty has 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;

&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s presentation . &quot;
these are questions that Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found a track later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house roughly one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people living there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b started his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he was a doctoral fellow in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when she met with common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elder guy who tried to teach her guitar play . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the wom@@ b of women . &quot;
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lam@@ b &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago , Lam@@ b met both on a sum@@ mer@@ time market . &quot;
later they played one or another gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes Entertainment @-@ Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September last time after Lam@@ b ended his guitar and harmon@@ ica aspi@@ rations . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and j@@ okes together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of joke . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at Emp@@ oria State University in Kans@@ as and was president of his brother and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lect@@ urers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;

&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b made the emergency call after being shot by Schmidt , and that Lam@@ b was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

&quot; the UN chief calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;

8 Responses to show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in poll@@ s down , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claimed that Tr@@ ump would probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now can now detect tr@@ umps of stam@@ ina and start losing their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current demand values indicating that the Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the Real Estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; in a poll conducted by CNN / ORC last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing about excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump critici@@ zed for his bomb@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters believe that the Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Supreme Commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters acc@@ use the idea .
&quot; if they put their money back , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; when they are asked who will win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a poll conducted by CNN / ORC out of the past week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters didn &apos;t have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump is harv@@ esting the majority support . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ therine and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have fixed their voices .
&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the topic of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tical expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s decisive Hez@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republican party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post poll on Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration is left in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s up to new heights .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ strated about the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;

a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ akos Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a confident start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze played a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel from Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ akos in hot atmosphere thanks to ru@@ bb@@ ish double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twelve @-@ year success in the series is expected to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; in his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller received good assistance from Olympi@@ akos @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ ke . &quot;

&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts , however , they were often un@@ riv@@ alled to works . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by the player storage on left outside Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; on the right , Müller had more luck than his flank from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ akos @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown sm@@ ashed the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct receipt , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto has par@@ ched with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians were acc@@ ustom@@ ed to their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to put con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;

s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
&quot; the controversial private lighting facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to more traditional dishes in its way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström , Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de faced the proposal as European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone will be created with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are concrete to the fact that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment firm .
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; so far , the process involved agreed to arbit@@ rators , a claim against their jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister is expected to be charged with excitement . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s ques@@ tioning and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to place the first of his six questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has prov@@ oked a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ le@@ agues @-@ Stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention &quot;
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliam@@ ent@@ arian party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour has put forward in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and pensions ministers , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the leaders of the prime minister is too front@@ ative , and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; punch strength &quot; &quot; and stri@@ pping with re@@ eds , and instead seeks to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister will be represented by him if he does not participate - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . &quot;
&quot; since it was broadcast first in 1990 on television , the questions with the prime minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ents , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ standing campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA reta@@ iler in South Australia and Western Australia in the run to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distribute samples distributed in I@@ GA stores and sell shop owners selling the banned tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be released further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ alers of food , alcohol and devices carry out its annual investment strategy . &quot;
&quot; it is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the east states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian Tennis Federation .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; fell through the not@@ orious engagement of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , and Har@@ rison declared : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f had a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was def@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against the UK . &quot;
&quot; a matter of which I &apos;m quite cour@@ age@@ ous , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the quar@@ rel , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on he has never had a problem with the other players he is being trained in the changing area , he is trained hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to concentrate fully on the competition and not all around the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; Hungary declar@@ es the emergency , and ri@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter over them , the migrants &quot; andi@@ zed &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian hos@@ tili@@ ties . &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; it must be held in talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - agreed that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent . &quot;
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a bal@@ ous action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having completed a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and has become an entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have a claim to protect - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Reporter of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Land Security Advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and hit a crowd in order to push it down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .

&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eled for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these origins have reduced . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has ple@@ dged , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton still has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage in Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of the democratic voters in the presidential elections say that they would support Clinton when she was nominated by the party . &quot;

&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially thri@@ lled .
&quot; the views are strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton , only about one quarter would love them enthusias@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic elect@@ orate of the presidential elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this over their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , quot@@ ing of your company at the Spon@@ sors board of the conference &quot;
&quot; since the Vice @-@ President raises a potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ mire , 57 percent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked by the local elections , who would vote for the party their second choice is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons followers more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;

&quot; five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ fl@@ est &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elect@@ orate . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , there is no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristics by voters in the elections of their party .

Bi@@ den cuts in the three candidates best at hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic voters in the elections see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about Hillary Clinton are using a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it does not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;

five members of br@@ otherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a clas@@ sy ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges will be filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transportation to hospital , which has contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go on a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ fy his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , the uten@@ sils , began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle above that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , hull and th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies every year in the Sh@@ ic@@ anas , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indictment because of the murder of the third gra@@ der for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ and@@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ official - this is anch@@ ored , we will also draw this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has resi@@ sted its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase of interest is , and the house @-@ se is advised to rise , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
&quot; what we do not know is how long it will take , and how long it will be stopped . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period which is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the advance of interest rate increases can be vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which will perhaps reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study to what happened after interest rate increases . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on stocks tend to appear later in the earnings cycle and the return of return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that would not have existed before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rate increases in a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; if this is different , &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade shows only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all ero@@ sion cycles of 1950 to now have taken place in a Super @-@ Cycle with increasing swing in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ rates very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest running the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the impact of bonds is faster than shares when they change their strategic course .

&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a defl@@ ation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed Income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit cl@@ amping has expanded and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed shar@@ pens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies will benefit from the larger proportion of their business activities in the US , profit from interest rates and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will become worse , as a rising dollar makes its products more expensive in the global market and also finance their debt . &quot;

Saudi Arabia puts down the collapse in some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were worn by the streets to bury those killed , who were killed as a crane at Mek@@ ka big mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went on to the Holy site , where only days before a building boom came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage journey , when the crane was down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca , thousands of people who continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group would not have to steal the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is forbidden to travel abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the large mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month , gathered together . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group did not have any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not at the disposal . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ ored the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ ch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a sec@@ lu@@ ded son , who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 @-@ 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in life of every healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government representatives ordered 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the killed , and the same amount of permanent injured . &quot;

the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of minist@@ erial abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Attorney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the accused had to disp@@ ose funds from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
the sports function@@ aries are also accused of financial crimes .
&quot; this fact divided the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; for the rejection of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represented that the association was not at any time an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries had only compens@@ ated for allow@@ ance and the sports club , for which they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; he said during the capture . &quot;
&quot; with the association , it has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it may only be made for debt . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the financial success of the compens@@ atory damages had been retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the trans@@ formations damages only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , package deals and non @-@ detailed booking seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and spar@@ es administ@@ ered the two accused together , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the association was not interested in detail for financial planning , but it was important to have been the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;

the def@@ endants told the accused .

&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor set in the room . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is no doubt that this is the case . &quot;
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; claim compensation . &quot;
&quot; why damages ? , judge and prosec@@ utor really wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this form@@ ulation , because the association never had any harm . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he has never obtained a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is watching if the US bank@@ note falls on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest paid to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ omy outlook on global relations . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
&quot; at the Delta State University , ap@@ ologies for the death of the &quot; &quot; Delta State University &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on day , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; do it &quot; , &quot; announced the authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number of 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said he had shot on someone , and one man killed . &quot;
&quot; according to the emergency call centre , Lam@@ b told the police officers to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I sm@@ ack my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the cler@@ k after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police took the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note by Lam@@ b , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as a polic@@ eman killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s presentation . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said Lam@@ b told me at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen hit him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled walking , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play months for a double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ ction of his right leg . &quot;
&quot; while this led to the left outside def@@ ender , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
&quot; in the dressing cabin , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he w@@ ept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .

&quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ Team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;

&quot; it is a matter that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost entirely . &quot;
&quot; it is because , you may be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 , op@@ ted Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s environmental label . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp &apos;s website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead depic@@ ts an ingredient of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , is hoping to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron presented itself partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the story of the book so little familiar . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not have read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s electoral circle .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there were no further comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res who selected England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side is probably less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , da - and I said this - players are their own best choices . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his post@@ ure , even though he did not bring so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test drum gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise is that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer that I guess .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must be at least the same odds as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of letting mos@@ ques in addition to Cook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and would get four qui@@ cks , di@@ ps up , and I don &apos;t have anything against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left h@@ anders has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s l of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has managed three hundred pieces immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the trainer staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all the conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh winds in the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in line with the previously thought . &quot;
&quot; the team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the timet@@ able . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in the heart .

&quot; a European diplom@@ a friend said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always of own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contracts that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it would not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;

&quot; my European friend who wants an outside Britain inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;

&quot; the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;

&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened him a door door . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 years , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I just press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arb@@ ure tendency and the wild plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provoc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old , when his old father tried on television to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleague , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his rivals and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bot@@ tom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the campaign campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion on lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign on the withdrawal , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital , - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ? &quot;
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government at the power , which was reminded of something that was reminded of the British influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; the claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Prin@@ ciples &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on the PH@@ E his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ level decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also under@@ wrote the references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an E @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he allegedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champions , some of which also provide sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco administration of PH@@ E took part . &quot;

&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear responsibility for the information of the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion per year . &quot;
&quot; through the clear premis@@ e of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the kind of programs , which are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public broad@@ cast@@ ers , likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard disp@@ uted times of time against the most popular shows of their rivals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were commissioned or sent that would also be clearly presented by non @-@ subsi@@ dised rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , you should at least give up the production at least on programs that others do not do or in order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I am proud to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts give this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue when they are on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion USD broadcast fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ struc@@ ted programs that nobody saw . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them ever .
&quot; at the broadcast fee , Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course you think everyone , we think everyone gets a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , said that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to form and enter@@ tain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be addressed to public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically altered nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change direction at the moment , in which they have sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for human hearing at high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
read more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms normally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the thro@@ mbo@@ sis cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ asonic to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ ins and transferred into the worms where they switch to the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above to the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around advertising for the weapons fair - by a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student housing
&quot; 11 years ago I went to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and at the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
&quot; the market data is clearly presented and can be easily incorporated into presentations , internal reports , etc . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to che@@ at : people tell where you come from and where you have taken Sab@@ baths , where you are standing in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t love to hate Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the seri@@ ousness , guys , it is just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your lashes were in fire and that fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and pay their under@@ wear . &quot;

&quot; your room should be a Refu@@ gi@@ um , but many student homes form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going on , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy I &apos;ve spent for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it a SMS instead .
speaking of pos : do it .
a guy in my student houses had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .

&quot; as you start the university on the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate of Brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats are a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will be associated with a delicious surprise at the end .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people asleep when you anchor . &quot;
&quot; to steal food , it is a common crime in student houses . &quot;
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added their milk a sink to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; they should not make noise , the people from sleep or work . &quot;
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that you are in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , because it &apos;s three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
she re@@ acted with more lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , leaving her door and sat down to her three hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would random@@ ly pull into the same student residence ?

&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has its keys in its not closed room , the border between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is more fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the massive accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ d : a ter@@ raced house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different when people enter@@ tain people in homes .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without grounds . &quot;

only in the cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however : we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but built luxury apartments that hardly afford to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only are refugees , but also the mother or the poor . &quot;

&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after the installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush fails or try to update via iTunes . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his ground transportation service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants 50,000 seasonal workers to set up for the holiday season . &quot;

&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was still expected that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday jobs were announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex achieved 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 per cent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to € 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which analysts predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts predicted . &quot;

&quot; on their most expected meeting in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a wall picture of the United States is threatening over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seat sa@@ ver . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues set up the economic interests of the nation before all other matters .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ protected third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets will fri@@ ghten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen these vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is just about a quarter percentage point . &quot;

&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to do not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification , still to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which is uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; for example , half of econom@@ ists who were interviewed recently by Bloom@@ berg have predicted a increase in interest rate this week . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists wi@@ pe the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average value jumped 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a interest rate increase would so@@ ak the financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen said in the spring and early summer that , despite the dis@@ comfor@@ ts of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; despite inflation constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world sent together the end of the last month , after China had de@@ preci@@ ated its currency . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was more than 16 % below its peak as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would become the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , while the Dow is now around 10 % below the threshold of May . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liners , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
now he says that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere suggestion of the former Lei@@ ters Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; close up its monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; acqu@@ itt@@ al , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates a stake in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its lead interest by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the USA , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis such as the market launch in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on interest rate settlement of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should take the time . &quot;

Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of babies who su@@ ck on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;

&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was in turn around the roof pitch , which is mandatory for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; is therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow the roof pitch to be &quot; &quot; exemp@@ t &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ri@@ eder common@@ place generally , in the rule of deliver@@ ables , is rather restri@@ ctive . &quot;

&quot; in total , Konrad was expecting a need of 85@@ .000 lod@@ gings in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police brut@@ ally shot a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a official official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , chief district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ hak@@ al said , the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before they res@@ orted to rubber boots . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber floors are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently such a high death rate produced . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ esti@@ a say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
&quot; there were protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people live longer with diabetes after weight loss surgery than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a gui@@ del@@ ine to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - Mag@@ b@@ ypass and magne@@ tism - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under those subjected to this operation , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ gone surgical procedure , 36 % of the type of diabetes disappeared completely and at 28 % . &quot;

&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you contra@@ dict in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist Guide called on to end violence in the native countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford that is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must reflect on how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented George B@@ ush@@ s action following the terrorist attack on September 11 and revealed that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the path to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lowed heavily alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years to report the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 to 2010 at 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them arrive in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children can deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some are doing to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube shows how young@@ sters drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have reportedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children . &quot;
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre in the hospital of Kans@@ as University Hospital , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sprit@@ zer from after straw@@ berry fragrance dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold used by an adult by law , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor of emergency medical center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored it overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; it was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s Mutter , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to take advantage of alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child . &quot;
&quot; in addition to alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a lethal solution , instead of eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was classified as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York state planned to po@@ ise their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; stor@@ z &quot; &quot; and instruc@@ ted discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority . &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; some later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day was near@@ er , I began to fear myself . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as seats , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , who will observe it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I can &apos;t .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone rates and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; she said , &quot; It would have been better to form@@ ulate it , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to which you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to stop racing
Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
&quot; he quoted the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing , and he has found himself under difficult conditions as it went to the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ ment at Li@@ dar@@ is that he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age allegations , and did not want it to be &quot; &quot; out like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been eating long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do this , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ ater .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves in their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to capture me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ der , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring that to the view that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and maybe people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
are I bad for the industry ?
I &apos;m so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is that they are thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ strations levels of the train@@ ers have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and late Sc@@ rat@@ ching concluded that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moody , the best known by his preparation of the un@@ loading master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ates the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy fights against rivals because of the claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a hard hil@@ ly note on the Storm team after his team achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she only concentrated on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading train@@ ers at his team was confident that they were worried , to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this is always up @-@ to @-@ date - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ en@@ sible system or techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles on a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . so he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this time is coming back to this season .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night , and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was around the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points a bit cl@@ amping ?
&quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;

&quot; in 2015 , the compact car has to be recorded , which is currently very good for sale . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were accounted for by the German force drive Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected in the IAA ( Public@@ ation Days 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models are presented in this year . &quot;
&quot; the Opel Astra , which is one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry , is one of the biggest refin@@ ements for the German automobile industry . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry under the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hesse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the main competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a fifth @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in spring of the station wagon , which is also shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA still on a new compact car ?

what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates that in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can create that . &quot;

&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without a German knowledge of welcome classes . &quot;

the rights are also duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must unite with a clear contact person and be prepared to work together with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control possibilities . &quot;

&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany now have their right to stay here , here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will still be a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society must change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NSU murder series , in the police and the authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist topic . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interests of non @-@ white German have long been calling for a long time and why international agreements , such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany , must become reality in the next few years when the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;

&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are less informed about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went to plan , there is no reason why he could not play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which is not well healed . &quot;
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his knu@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical terms , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has reported 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious cycle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an unpleasant period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain battle strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will be running a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to take a little break break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake , measured at the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and will be driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially regarding the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common among men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of putting the culture into question , the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; &quot; healthy mood &quot; , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends will hal@@ ve the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you have to have friends only once , that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication @-@ led communication , with its emphasis on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , vital , vital and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the Beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at soccer fans in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the telephone pastoral ministry told me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ ici@@ ously endanger@@ ed , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone can help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely new setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you &apos;re sitting alone in Star@@ bucks someone alone , give him a smile and tell you Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .

angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria was less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French Masters to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead as Cav@@ ani made a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , since it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ o @-@ rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he was later joined in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could hold 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the first league , but was pushed out by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö @-@ defense , he passed away beautifully into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , who struck the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was raised with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post at the 3@@ 4. minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ p@@ auses and bad statements , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who did not have less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play and it was a pass from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which turned Di Maria into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole . &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored its sixth Chall@@ enger after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had found a left flank of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thought that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized by the end . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers past Minnes@@ ota Tw@@ ins past
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
the Tw@@ ins lost a chance to climb up within a half of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League Wild@@ card place .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad exc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , considered Detroit three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I will completely concentrate on the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first runs until mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has w@@ rest@@ led the sle@@ e@@ pless estate , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to get into the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was this in the Major League leading 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings added a Insurance @-@ Run , wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however S@@ ano , in three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit has benefited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veteran , who had been stolen from the vulner@@ ability of the injury list after losing more than one month due to a back @-@ suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch da in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the runners at scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers laid a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit him well , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever Right Wing A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three races at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

&quot; he received the city at that time , as a ver@@ itable sin be@@ ak . &quot;

Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the aband@@ on@@ ment of the Western Church .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown crown is one of the main works that Oth@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
&quot; at the beginning , the word was ? &quot;
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now available with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and screen in 150 moti@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the particular themes , it can be quite no@@ isy . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked with his Bible project for which he has met a subj@@ ectively @-@ artistic selection from the many subjects of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; there are cycles that focus on topics such as cros@@ sings , pla@@ gues , command@@ ments or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has been on the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ blical places . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages of Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into present contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible version of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts to the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden let@@ tering .
&quot; the 75 year old allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; in the end , emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order . &quot;
&quot; then the up@@ bringing came to the pipe @-@ stock , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I tried to work that to me perhaps again with the Lord Father .
&quot; his second concern is to help art in fast @-@ pac@@ ed times : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is characterised by advertising , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; , &quot; discover and sense what force they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; &quot; I like how to compreh@@ end with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ end the Bible , but also chosen for him important , also mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler von Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which look fri@@ ghtening thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it is real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitor of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his mind at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he had been on the other hand , for : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written the fashion history , without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographi@@ cally chore@@ ographi@@ cally chore@@ ographic work for which much effort was done : to ref@@ resh dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;

&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ely fashionable attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy BH@@ s and clothes , G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents didn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I mean , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he steel fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers such as G@@ aul@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later , I bought them , but of course I bought them . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have the models to pay . &quot;

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Plau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , covering blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone works no more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ ist@@ ital Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Plau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ che , is an increasing contract potential . &quot;

our products reach our customers in this way .
&quot; today in the Asian region , mass goods are produced much cheaper today and almost exclusively driven by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports to Russia and the US are currently weak@@ ening . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; diplom@@ a designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger out@@ enst@@ elle of the West @-@ Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts , specializing in embroi@@ dery and tips . &quot;
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designer and the companies , who have to think of everything economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often just slightly different to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ bu@@ ys the historical snow point of snow . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the machine sti@@ pul@@ ates little kit@@ chens at some places . &quot;
&quot; the Plau@@ ener gold@@ smith in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; before I could not start with a traditional Plau@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , she defines the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plau@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and surroundings , and would like to have a souven@@ ir . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as modern ambass@@ adors of the Plau@@ ener tip . &quot;
