these panels need to be fitted in such a way that they are well visible ; they must be removable .
( 1 ) A separate Car@@ net TI@@ R is required for each road vehicle or container .
&quot; however , a single car@@ net can be produced for a load train or for several containers , which are loaded on a single road vehicle or a truck . &quot;

&quot; it must contain at least as many separ@@ able acceptance and completion sections , as required for the relevant transport . &quot;

&quot; customs authorities can set a deadline for the journey through their country and require that the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry train or the container hold a prescribed route . &quot;
&quot; the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the container must be carried out with the loading of the goods and the corresponding Car@@ net TI@@ R of each passage clearance and the identification keys for inspection . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The customs duties of each contracting party generally acknowledge the in@@ conclu@@ sive tari@@ ffs imposed by the customs authorities of the other contracting parties , unless a confis@@ cation of goods is carried out in accordance with Article 5 ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the customs authorities can , however , create their own tari@@ ffs if necessary for the control . &quot;
( 2 ) The customs associations recognized by a contracting party enjoy the same legal protection as the national tari@@ ffs in their territory .

&quot; - on the road a control and a sh@@ elling of the loading of road vehicles , lor@@ ries or containers . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities take charge of the loading of goods of a road vehicle , a truck or a container at a transit duty or on the road , so they must pay attention to the car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their country , on the corresponding branches and on the car@@ net TI@@ R remaining sections , the newly designed customs closures and the type of checks carried out . &quot;
&quot; if customs closures are injured or damaged in other than the cases listed in articles 24 and 35 , or if goods are destroyed or damaged without violation of the customs procedures , the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 shall be included in the Car@@ net TI@@ R process ; the internal legislation remains un@@ affected . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route , at which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R in the area of a contracting party does not use the Car@@ net because easier procedures for customs clearance offer or the use of such a method is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In such cases , customs offices , where the TI@@ R transport is suspended or resum@@ ed , shall apply as a transit point at the exit or exit customs office at the entrance . &quot;

the customs duties of each contracting party recognise the tari@@ ffs and / or niche signs attached by the competent authorities of the other parties to the contract .
&quot; however , you can add customs and / or niche signs in addition to the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in your country , on the relevant pedi@@ gre@@ es and on the car@@ net TI@@ R remaining c@@ utt@@ ings and / or niche signs . &quot;
&quot; if customs authorities have to remove tari@@ ffs or remove a post account for a restriction of the loading of goods , they notice the car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their country , on the corresponding regular sheets and on the car@@ net TI@@ R remaining c@@ utt@@ ings and / or niche signs remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;

&quot; if one of the customs authorities has proved satisfactory proof that the goods listed in the material manifest@@ o of a Car@@ net TI@@ R have been lost or lost again by accident or force or that they are missing due to their condition due to their natural swelling , liberation from the usual meadow will be granted to substantial tari@@ ffs and donations . &quot;

( B ) The organisation requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with the Convention .
&quot; ( II ) The provision of information on facilities is limited to the minimum level required for the use of securing measures in respect of core material , which is subject to the provisions of the provisions in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) In search of the community , the organization is prepared to examine investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organisation to become materi@@ ally superf@@ lu@@ ous , provided they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and the states to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II . abol@@ ishes the community either against a proposed denom@@ ination or at any time against a specified nam@@ ing , so the organization of the Community and the States suggests one or more alternative nam@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; if due to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ eded on the basis of this Convention , the Council will discuss the refusal when the General Director of the Organization - in the following acts as &quot; the Director General , &quot; shall discuss with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The community and the concerned states undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation can actually provide them according to their Convention .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information to the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , to carry out tasks under this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures for this agreement are concluded with respect to nuclear material when the Community and the organization determine that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able for nuclear activity , which is under the viewpoint of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; according to the provisions of this convention , the association noti@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the states which are subject to the provisions of the provisions in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the provisions of the provisions in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated with regard to nuclear material as soon as the recipient &apos;s state , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has assumed responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any transmission and , if applicable , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; if nuclear material , which is subject to the provisions of this Convention , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the association agrees with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated following this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
&quot; II ) For the duration of the non @-@ application of the preventive measures , the score will not be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les . &quot;
B ) The organisation and the community make a provision that the securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention will not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures fores@@ een in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization will be held on the ongoing basis of the total amount and the composition of this material contained in the respective state or the concerned States , and any passing on such material from this state or state . &quot;
&quot; this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or an under sec@@ rec@@ y prot@@ ection@@ ist knowledge of military activity and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow in the implementation of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the association , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , however extraordinary costs due to a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has been resolved in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling that is required by the organization &apos;s inspec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim to the Community or the State against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or the State for damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , arising from the implementation of the security measures pursuant to this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council after the examination of the relevant information submitted by the General Director determines that the organization is not able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures , for nuclear weapons or other core bla@@ sting bodies , it can reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , also take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been acquired by the applied preventive measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties involved is concerned - any justi@@ fiable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement , should be examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council encourages the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this convention are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement , and which shall not be submitted by the negotiation or any other procedure agreed by the organization , the community and the States , to submit an arbit@@ ral tribunal to an arbitr@@ ator composed of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four appointed arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth arbitr@@ ator who presi@@ des over the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization are not named by two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration , the community or the organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention enters into non @-@ nuclear non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this convention . &quot;
&quot; II ) if the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its safegu@@ ards in relation to this state , for the purposes of this convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties concerning a change in this convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall promptly inform all Member States of the Organization of each amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures for entry into force are completed . &quot;
( B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol .
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the Part I provisions , as required . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the preventive measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the removal of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bla@@ sting bodies for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such bran@@ ching by the risk of early detection . &quot;
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial ren@@ unciation and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the audi@@ ts by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material which is not shown for a certain period is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in the event of their verification , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material pursuant to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their preventive measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , if necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock , core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
( e ) procedures for the assessment of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory including the one and the outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
g ) arrangements to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures following this agreement are not limited to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; ( B ) Ur@@ an or th@@ orium containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; ( C ) The core material that is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ al enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or is used in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The provisions fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to provisions under Article 11 , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community about the use of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The provisions fores@@ een in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the Organization shall exemp@@ t the following core material from the provisions of the provisions following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in gram or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the Organization shall liber@@ ate nuclear material which would otherwise be subject to preventive measures pursuant to this agreement , provided that the entire material quantity delivered in the States is at no point in any time due to this Article in the States . &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment that lies below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ time square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to , processed or stored in accordance with the provisions of this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are made on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community meets with the Organization of supplementary agreements which , in the scope required for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organisation under this Convention , determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied . &quot;
supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without alter@@ ing this convention in agreement between the organisation and the community .
&quot; the complementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the integration between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organisation will set up a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this agreement , regardless of its origin , and further this inventory account as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
( D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC organization has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the organization as Administrator of the transaction , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the transaction account is separate and dis@@ connected from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment will be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes issued by the member state , to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state in order of the organization as car@@ et@@ aker of the special transaction account and to deposit at the agency of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . of the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this Agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution on January 1 , 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State shall be able to make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dead@@ lines .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the ste@@ ward takes about proportion@@ ate cuts to the cash or the Notes , in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit disposition to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly inv@@ alu@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered , approved , approved and managed according to the procedures and practices identified for the purposes of the Organization financed by the Organization . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction account may not be used in place of the Bank &apos;s Bank or the Organization instead of the Bank &apos;s principal funds for reconstruction and development ( Bank ) or the organisation , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of entry into force . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment terms that apply to the organization granted by the organization ; therefore , they are re@@ payable in 50 years in the event of ten years . &quot;
&quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies from the Member States , and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts for the payment of these bi@@ kers are to be paid directly to the organisation it reserves .
&quot; each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is indicated . &quot;
&quot; the recei@@ pts from each transaction loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to what the manager , at the time of the loan granted , could be the recipient of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back to the Member State as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; until full allocation of all transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the E@@ EC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of re@@ payment of the transaction loan , the Man@@ age Group conduc@@ ts the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
the ste@@ ward transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed settlement of the transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are drawn from the accounts payable to the account and deposits paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als on the Member States . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the administrators work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account , provide an exchange of views on the state of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or plans financed through special transactions , and on any other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organisation agree , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of capital paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
governments of the Member States note the general sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat shall forward these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the named Noti@@ fications in the Organization .
&quot; this agreement is dra@@ fted in two origin@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally binding . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a correspondence to the amend@@ ment of Anne@@ x A of Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T has adopted the following : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN atomic community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large testing facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as the Common Company J@@ ET , following the Eur@@ atom Treaty . &quot;
Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
&quot; as up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have achieved a higher priority due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable each contracting party to take the greatest possible use by combining its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and therefore to achieve the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ expe@@ dient generation of electricity through the use of controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties shall associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; every time the parties accept a new program , this is the place of the programmes listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association shall be realised in paragraph 1 through : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - exchange of personnel among the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; associated third states &quot; , &quot; as well as the laboratories that work with the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the Parties shall conclude an association agreement , which is as far as possible to those identified between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved with the date of entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of the human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resource Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the present agreement to the Joint Company J@@ ET whose constitution accepts it . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become contractual partner of any contract with its aim in the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , entrusted with the execution of the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present Agreement , are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the setting up of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the Eur@@ atom programme , carries out this task in respect of all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the Associ@@ ated Institu@@ tions and direc@@ ts their T * validity in the interests of both parties to the common goal stated in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the scientific and technological developments that are emerging in the world . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities ask for it . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Group , which provides the VG research proposals with a view to the fact that the funds granted to the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task in respect of all research and development work that is refer@@ enced in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented in the committee of directors conven@@ ed in the Eur@@ atom programme by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
&quot; the Board of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out in the programme , will be carried out in an optimal way with respect to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees implemented within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which offer appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , personnel and knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F comprises a representative of every Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions and the preparation of the future programmes and the establishment of its total scope , co @-@ ordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of merger . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Committee of directors , the advisory groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG towards the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of human resource exchange .
&quot; the representatives of the two contracting parties have an effect on the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme is set annually to an amount that is attributable to the Eur@@ atom programme at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint undertaking as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland grants an amount to the Joint Company J@@ ET , to be set in accordance with the financial provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Eur@@ atom to finance the work in the context of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work , which are made due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares with the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expendi@@ tures within the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned . &quot;
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
&quot; in addition , the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are specified in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to liber@@ ate Eur@@ atom from duties or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , the items acquired or acquired there may not be sold un@@ paid or free of charge in this country unless subject to conditions which are approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ties are not applicable to rest sal@@ aries and managers who are paid to these individuals .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge , which apply to the association specified in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present Agreement , are governed in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on Human Resource Exchange . &quot;
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge , which apply to the participation of Switzerland at the Joint Company J@@ ET , are governed in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Statute of the Common Company . &quot;

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial situation
&quot; the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks provide an appropriate application . &quot;
&quot; the agreements may be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; even now , however , some terms have been mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each Stand@@ by Credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without being exceeded for a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; in the opening of the loans as well as their possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be eff@@ ected before the end of a month after the conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the BC@@ Cs at the conclusion of the agreement at the disposal of the available currencies , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the funds of the bank , probably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applies at the given time to transactions carried out under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ S must acquire the necessary funds in the market itself , then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the Libor hei@@ gh@@ tened by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so .
&quot; the BI@@ S could conclude a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks provide an appropriate application . &quot;
I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I honor to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter . &quot;

the parties of the Convention to carry out Article VII of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agre@@ ements - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Convention . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and the request expressed by the Committee for Trade Uni@@ ations at its meeting of 11 and 12 April 1979 , to a uniform version of an agreement to carry out Article VII of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement , &quot;
&quot; given that Article 27 of the Convention on Chan@@ ges has not entered into force , &quot;
1 . agree to cancel the determination of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
2 . recognise that the postpon@@ ement of the application of this agreement to developing countries may be insufficient by five years in accordance with Article 21 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 in practice for some developing countries .
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the deadline stated in Article 21 ( 1 ) , with the agreement that the contracting parties may consider such an application in cases where the development country can offer good reasons ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . recognise that developing countries , who currently conduct customs valuation on the basis of official minimum values , if necessary , want to make a reservation in order to retain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions that the contracting parties agree to ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . recognize that developing countries , who are of the opinion , can cause actual difficulties to reverse the order of application according to Article 4 , may have the wish to make the following reservation on Article 4 : &quot;
the Government of : ... reserves the right to declare that the relevant provision of Article 4 shall only be applied if the customs authorities apply for application of Article 5 and 6 in reverse order .

&quot; if developing countries have such reservations , the parties to the contract give their agreement to this subject in accordance with Article 23 ; &quot;
&quot; 6 . notice that some developing countries have expressed concern that in the implementation of Article 1 of the Convention , problems may arise , insofar as it relates exclusively to single representatives or sole propriet@@ ors into their countries . &quot;
parties agree that in the event of occurrence of such problems in developing countries that apply the Convention on the application of these countries a study of this question is carried out to find suitable solutions ;
&quot; 7 . agree that Article 17 shall acknowledge that customs administr@@ ations must carry out investigations in the application of the Convention , in order to convince themselves of the correctness or accuracy of information , declarations or documents issued for the determination of customs duties . &quot;
&quot; they also agree that the article recognis@@ es that investigations can be carried out , for example , to verify whether the values specified or presented to the customs duties are complete and correct in connection with the receipt of a customs value . &quot;
&quot; they acknowledge that contractual parties have the right to count on the full participation of the operators in these investigations , subject to their national legislation and procedures ; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations regarding the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in weight @-@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the amount of stock actually executed does not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to the standard offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trading , the two parties agree to each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community makes use of the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the accession of Argentina to the Community market is not affected by this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; upon entry into new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set by number 2 corresponding to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burdens for these new Member States shall be determined according to the rules of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the VAT rate mentioned under number 5 will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is set to 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight with Greece &apos;s accession to the community . &quot;
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed amounts .
&quot; in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of inter@@ vention@@ ist stocks of frozen meat because of the implementation of the regulation the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of amm@@ uni@@ tion and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place in accordance with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms must be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina ass@@ ures compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that within the quantities specified in this agreement , export lic@@ ences for the products listed under number 1 are issued . &quot;
&quot; the Community ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way as to wai@@ ve the status of a deposit for issuing import license for the goods that are question@@ able .
&quot; implementing regulations also stipul@@ ates that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority will inform the competent authority of the community in regular intervals , for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be en@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency of the hammer - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the conditions of sales in these markets , including conditions specified for the goal mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall take care that the proper application of this agreement will not be com@@ promised by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will be carried out according to the Community under the agreement . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of this Agreement and recommends the appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties in the context of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep market and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and especially after the community for New Zealand &apos;s economy are exist@@ enti@@ fic and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honour the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled chicken , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement New Zealand is granted access to the community market for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;

&quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance specified on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or symptoms may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be analyzed to double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in the volume of blood cell in@@ und@@ ations in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has set international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are worked out at present . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard ingredient contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most species is expressed as an ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ cker which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ filtration .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the tit@@ ration of the unknown agent in international units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sh@@ ears according to definition 256 International units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be maintained for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to the label , lies at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can enter . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ti@@ sed or re @-@ dissolved serum .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re@@ opening , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least until an International Convention on a uniform system has come about . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
&quot; the quantity , which is in a container , must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; adequate samples of all re@@ agents distributed can be stored for so long from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups . &quot;
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin exclusively contain substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substance of human origin .
&quot; each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the amount or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ opening , &quot;

&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these Ser@@ a are specific for the C an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are washed up in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 against c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a Tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form Anti @-@ D ) , must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ vitamin or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies to the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer must be effective at the same time . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .

&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion falls within the sphere of competence of the community , which , according to the contract , by which it was founded , has the necessary authority to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from the date of its entry into force , this supplementary protocol is part of the Convention . from that point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming a contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the member states of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection in the sense of Article 2 and the time of entry into force of this additional protocol pursuant to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; in THE A@@ mend@@ ment , that this Convention may not be interpreted in a way that it ent@@ ails the contracting parties from their obligations arising from other international agreements . &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a single delivery paper ) is implemented in order to use the common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping ) in goods traffic between the contracting parties . &quot;
the form@@ alities associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are provided by means of a single document to be used for the pre @-@ print@@ ings according to the samples in the App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the paper paper serves as a registration or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to be explicitly requested to carry out legal regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the case of any use of the single document ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the parties involved , so that they may come to the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the Parties to apply simplified procedures , even in the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The simplified procedure may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not to be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; in addition , the submission of an incomplete registration can be permitted . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an application must subsequently be submitted , in which the relevant authorities will be able to submit a peri@@ odic advance notice , within the deadline stated by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use trading papers instead of single api@@ ece . &quot;

&quot; if applicable , the customs authority of the country of destination or the transit country of the applicant or its representative in this country may request a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Not@@ withstanding paragraph 1 , registration shall always be made in one of the official languages of the import country , if in this country , under the use of other than that of the customs authority of the export or col@@ lo@@ qui@@ al country , copies of the registration shall be made . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the required copies required for each individual proced@@ ural section of a goods trade between the parties , where necessary copies may be provided to assist the for@@ esters in the following paragra@@ phs . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 may not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective shipments , the competent authorities may , however , present that the alle@@ gations for export and the shipping procedure must be carried out on one and the same pr@@ elo@@ ad by means of the copies intended for these for@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities will be convinced that the information contained in the copies of the registration in the individual proceedings coinci@@ de . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure smooth goods traffic between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the Custom@@ s authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they consider it interest for another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;

&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or refusal of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its grounds for the seeking land shall be communicated without delay . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country seeks official assistance , which it could not afford , if it were sought therefore , it instruc@@ ts in its search for this circum@@ stance . &quot;

&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Mi@@ xed Committee has accepted a decision under the reservation of the provision of the constitutional requirements , the decision , if no date is mentioned , will take effect on the first day of the second month after notification of the lifting of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party will take appropriate measures to ensure effective and balanced implementation of this convention , taking into account the need to disman@@ tle the goods that are subjected to the goods traffic as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions to the difficulties resulting from the provisions of this Convention . &quot;

( translation ) International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System to design@@ ate and codi@@ fy the goods ( events on Brussels on 14 June 1983 )
&quot; the contractual parties DI@@ ES@@ ES Convention , which has been worked out under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the Council for cooperation in the field of customs duties - &quot;
&quot; DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to facilitate the acquisition , compar@@ ability and evaluation of statistical data , especially those of international trade ; &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to lower the costs caused by the fact that in international trading goods goods have to be re @-@ lab@@ elled and re @-@ enco@@ ded at the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of trading documents and transmission of data , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that the development of technology and structures of international trade necess@@ itated significant changes to the Brussels agreement of 15 December 1950 on the customs tari@@ ff scheme for the entry of the goods into customs tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the scale of differentiation that is required by the governments and the economy for customs and statistical purposes is presently far above the one contained in the system to the above @-@ mentioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; knowing that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; weighing that the harmon@@ ised system should be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of various types of transport , &quot;
&quot; in the calculation , that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included as far as possible into the systems used in trading for the designation and encoding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that the harmon@@ ised system should help to establish a close relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other , IN THE EN , that a close inter@@ relationship between the harmon@@ ised system and the International War@@ p Directory should be maintained for foreign trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations , &quot;
&quot; in the calculation that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined customs tari@@ ff and statistical cl@@ ature , which is appropri@@ ated for use by the parties involved in international trade ; &quot;
&quot; knowing that it is important to ensure adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for cooperation in the field of customs duties , for the harmon@@ ised system in this field , &quot;
&quot; in THE sense that - although the above agreement on the customs tari@@ ff scheme has proved to be an effective tool to achieve some of these goals , the conclusion of a new international convention is the most appropriate way to achieve the desired result - &quot;
&quot; in terms of this agreement , a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods , &quot; referred to in the app@@ endi@@ x to this Convention , consists of positions and sub @-@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , from notes to paragra@@ phs . chapters and sub @-@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ised system ; &quot;

&quot; C ) &quot; &quot; Statisti@@ cs Theory &quot; &quot; of a party party specified by a contracting party to document the data required for the implementation of import and export statistics ; &quot;
&quot; D ) &quot; &quot; Com@@ bin@@ ed customs tari@@ ff and statistical cl@@ ature &quot; &quot; a nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature agreement signed by a contracting party for registration of goods in the import@@ ation of goods ; &quot;
amend@@ ment to the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods ( events to Brussels on 24 June 1986 )
&quot; the contractual parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for cooperation in the field of customs duties , &quot;
&quot; it is desirable , that , on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System to design@@ ate and codi@@ fy the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in the weighing that without a change of Article 13 of the stated agreement , the date of the entry into force of this agreement would continue to remain uncertain . &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System in Brussels on 14 June 1983 on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and codi@@ fication of the goods , in the following &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; , &quot; paragraph 1 receives the following form : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on January 1 , which , after the exp@@ iry of at least three months , follows immediately upon the date of which at least sevent@@ een of the countries referred to in Article 11 have signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or deposited their rati@@ fication or membership documents , but not before January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; A. This protocol also enters into force simultaneously with the Convention , provided that at least sevent@@ een of the states or customs or business uni@@ ons signed in Article 11 of the Convention have deposited their document on the adoption of the Protocol to the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat for cooperation in the field of customs duties . &quot;
&quot; however , only States or Custom@@ s or Business Uni@@ ons can submit a document on the adoption of this protocol that previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time sign it or deposited its document on rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention or at the same time . &quot;
&quot; B . any state and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the convention according to the entry into force of this protocol in accordance with paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the am@@ ended by the Protocol . &quot;
&quot; - a plant which is indispensable not only for the maintenance and maintenance of soils , but also allows the exploitation of land which does not allow any other planting , and which re@@ acts to any improvement in cultivation methods even in extensive crops , which are the main part of today &apos;s production . &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that its cultivation depends on the existence and living standards of millions of families , which in turn depend wholly on the measures to maintain and expand the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the non @-@ producing consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and table olive are essential ingredients in the areas where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that the essential feature of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in the production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer prices ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F that this causes all particular difficulties which can seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in the countries , which are in zones where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F the extraordinary importance of olive production for the economy of many countries , especially the olive growing countries in development ; &quot;
