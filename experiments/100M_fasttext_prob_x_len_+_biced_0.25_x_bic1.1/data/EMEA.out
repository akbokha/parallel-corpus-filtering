&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. enter@@ tain thoughts and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic elation ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat mild to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or using the ur@@ inary tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are degra@@ ded just like Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably appears primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , however , has a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its occurrence . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was studied in three trials over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 30@@ 1 patients suffering from bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest associated with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
all studies examined the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms based on a standard bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to study how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking out ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , in four of the five short @-@ term studies , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled sugar@@ s ) , ac@@ ath@@ ema ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from severe to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who were predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , were out@@ weighed against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and related their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ eric and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ n@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy should be considered , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist family , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ines ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ isations . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data storage for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Parkinson &apos;s , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ c@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study of more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phase kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and its occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro aria pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the end of the coup d &quot; é@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the share of response patients adher@@ ing to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; measured values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher decline in the incidence of reg@@ ression which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ k@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) compared with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosing of 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed in week 12 a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium and hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar recur@@ rence , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ness is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ isations via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isations via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences concerning the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose trial in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impact of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ onset carcin@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average stop @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not exceed 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets of Abi@@ li@@ fy can alternatively use the melting tablets , alternatively to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar recur@@ rence , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were based on dos@@ ages , which lead to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at recommended clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets of Abi@@ li@@ fy can alternatively use the melting tablets , alternatively to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; 71 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
200 mg of fru@@ ct@@ ose per ml 400 mg of glucose per ml 1.8 mg meth@@ yl @-@ 4 hydro@@ xy@@ ben@@ zo@@ ate ( E@@ 2@@ 18 ) per ml 0.2 mg prop@@ yl @-@ 4 hydro@@ xy@@ ben@@ zo@@ ate ( E@@ 2@@ 16 ) per ml .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ines ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in a controlled study of more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ k@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) compared with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks of fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) in a relative bio @-@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to healthy subjects .
99 Besi@@ des a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; once clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ast@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently than by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alco@@ hol@@ ism or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescri@@ bing or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ eric and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with the after all@@ some adoption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used as one @-@ off intra@@ muscular dosage and at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist family , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ dan was greater compared with the after all@@ some donation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and its occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of det@@ achment / behavior disorders associated with placebo , and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement of the bas@@ eline at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ bility , a similar effectiveness has been observed regarding the total population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a decreased number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 was the share of response patients adher@@ ing to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly increased improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ k@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) compared with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar recur@@ rence , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater after injection of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time up to the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to IV application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure occurred , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dosage , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ state ( AU@@ C ) normal @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was identified as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine in three quarters . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any application or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who had conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing drugs . &quot;
&quot; if only patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it should also not be used in patients who have low or low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood prior to treatment .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing drugs and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel containing drugs it was not necessary to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the launching of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ rop@@ hic number &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment must be interrupted until bet@@ ter@@ ment to Grade 1 or 2 is reached , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with impaired ren@@ al function were performed and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which may have substantially different pharmac@@ ological features than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated in patients until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils rose to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are recommended , during and up to six months after treatment no child to produce . &quot;
&quot; prior to the treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ tainment as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect traffic efficiency and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events occurring in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated at the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in table 1 , the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , or@@ ale pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , muscular sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness , very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ hydr@@ ation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components is medi@@ ated into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ escence receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor appears due to the alb@@ umin@@ ated protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ handed un@@ related studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metastatic lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metasta@@ sis and 19 % for metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; the results for general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are outlined below . &quot;
increased neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy compared to bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
&quot; the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way . &quot;
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or soft pac@@ ing of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel have been compared with IV 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) compared to a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel and the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose of less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients over 75 years of age , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light for over 8 hours .

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if an own blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml should be expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems an an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enabled them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; when administered as an injection into a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either out@@ stre@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the modification of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed fl@@ amed amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ el@@ ly mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; it should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , proof was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company Medi@@ ce Dru@@ gs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion exists due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients with which the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor is necessary . &quot;
a rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient via or under the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest dose , which is necessary for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia . &quot;
these clinical results indicate that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia being less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia being less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose rise of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor is necessary . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the cell number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the cell count increased by ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , an address on epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the stre@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg to 10 consecutive days , on the day of the procedure as well as 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic des@@ al@@ ination solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ stri@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a stre@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases in patients suffering from a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease , or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently experienced heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months up to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be examined and the common causes of non @-@ addressing ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxide toxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the reverse loc@@ cul@@ ation ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ id @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is due to the application of epo@@ et@@ ins , if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control an@@ a@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tive failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients under chemotherapy should consider epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that need to be trans@@ fi@@ gured ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) a month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk balance involving the patient &apos;s involvement which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly , if possible , prior to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially for underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial an@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F for hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , ret@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; the biotechn@@ ologically recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content are identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ thetic patients . &quot;
&quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ ome , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis . &quot;
survival and progression @-@ progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy , with the aim of transferring a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( oste@@ opor@@ osis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and might be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies , with approximately 20 times the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ec@@ tal body weight , dela@@ ying the os@@ sil@@ fication and an increase in fo@@ etal mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro studies with cells made of human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of an out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of maximum 3 days outside the cooling cabinet and not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are marked with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glued @-@ on label , so that , if necessary , the measurement of particle quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the indications listed above .
&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the recommended level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy . &quot;
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .

&quot; • If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a blood drop has occurred in the past . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ treats during further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before starting therapy with se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia was very rare . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection to a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are again in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or shr@@ ink@@ age , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels do not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of se@@ amed .
&quot; 200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your stre@@ amed dose accordingly , in order to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred in the past ( e.g. deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;

&quot; if a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery is about to come to you , the reason for your an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to treatment beginning with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / have recently been taken / applied , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice weekly , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic her@@ nia like falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ected into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ lo@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease , Ac@@ lo@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood once again norm@@ alized , or at least 75 % compared with the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study of elderly women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % compared with placebo over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those taking placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients in placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of Ac@@ lo@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ lo@@ sta cannot be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ lo@@ sta provides explanations for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ lo@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how the medicine is to be used , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ lo@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease , Ac@@ lo@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the disease . &quot;
after treatment of the Pa@@ get disease with Ac@@ lo@@ sta a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ lo@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ lo@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) If patients with cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended , there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and juven@@ iles Ac@@ lo@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data on safety and efficacy are absent . &quot;
Ac@@ lo@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; prior to use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , breast cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
no data is available for patients who need dental interventions if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported in cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , un@@ desired drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with kidney function decrease ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ lo@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the disease @-@ pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the morph@@ ine Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ lo@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as red@@ dening , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was professionally treated , mainly in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery . &quot;
&quot; 7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ 1.5 and at least two light or medium @-@ heavy existing spinal frac@@ tures ≤ -@@ 2.5 , or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric cereb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spine frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) . &quot;
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip by 6.0 % , of the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es was taken from the pool ridge . &quot;
&quot; in the case of placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ T ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone structure . &quot;
&quot; bone turnover markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ lo@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ lo@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D on the total pen@@ cils and she@@ ar neck compared to placebo treatment at all points of time . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , the Ac@@ lo@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % of the total pen@@ cils and 4.3 % of the fem@@ oral neck . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in placebo @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven , mainly light to moderate heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper average value when taking into the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ lo@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ dents at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , compared with 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , during an average follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; in 64 patients , the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent , yiel@@ ded unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ a 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long eli@@ oration phase with a terminal eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is primarily tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the rate of concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface area below the curve ( plasma concentration of time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes metabol@@ ised substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans , and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
&quot; because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; studies in dogs were given single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C for 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; in dogs , a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg was administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( cum@@ ulative dose , equivalent to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions exceeding the maximum of intended human exposure occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ b@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats were observed in rats from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and those of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease patho@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is performed too quickly , and new bone material is constructed uni@@ form@@ ly , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta works by restoring bone reconstruction , providing normal bone formation and rein@@ forcing the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you are using ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines / have recently been taken / applied even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
&quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta in combination with food and drinks , you are worried that you will have sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a vein . &quot;
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion to a vein .
&quot; since Ac@@ lo@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if missed by the administration of Ac@@ lo@@ sta , immediately contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before stopping the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider stopping the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent following the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ lo@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have such symptoms as you have received Ac@@ lo@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low cal@@ ci@@ um- concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or craw@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling / sensation , di@@ zz@@ iness , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , stomach pain , pain in ga@@ stri@@ tis , pain , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , swelling , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine , tissue damage and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; reported allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the reported side effects will seriously affect you or notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of acet@@ one , patients must be provided with sufficient fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ mia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ lo@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over and , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or over ) and beyond . &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted in over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking in comparison with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , studies on setting the smoking showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause suicide thanks to a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is provided while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ an@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia regarding weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; he is also present in patients who - besides obesity - do not show any apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close relatives ) should point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and to immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; 5.3 Pres@@ sure clinical data for safety and adverse effects not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were evaluated as potentially relevant for the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a long period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which permitted a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders . &quot;
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ As for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , enabling type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the effectiveness of acet@@ one in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ critical ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to operate Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently adjusted with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under the age of 18 , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attacks or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in the report on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enz@@ ym@@ phs ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be controlled again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ hanging problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ phs are to be reviewed . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is continued should be guided by the laboratory parameters prior to clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can ag@@ itate fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
hem@@ odi@@ lution resulted in a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or three @-@ way combination therapy with insulin or as two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin , are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported as an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescription doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study lasting 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies evaluating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel block@@ ers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not able from present data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege were compared with placebo over three times the upper limit of the normal range , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however more frequently , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study spann@@ ing over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for more than two years to investigate the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the onset of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been sufficiently adjusted with insulin for three months was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 week study of type 2 diabetes patients . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol were observed as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ min@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zide . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ ular vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the thre@@ ef@@ old efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; interaction studies showed that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one had no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to the oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; mean plasma @-@ elimination of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with impaired ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys showed concur@@ rent plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder was induced . &quot;
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study lasting 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study for more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both via an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the tot@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative medication , there was an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study lasting 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , acet@@ amp@@ ane doses may need to be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to the European Commission for launching Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a quick initial action is desired together with lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood glucose control has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can detect hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first doses or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before trips that go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to catch the advice of his doctor since such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) sites on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites cul@@ tured by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human@@ ely ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; in addition , acet@@ am@@ p@@ id doses may need to be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to operate Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be raised , followed by the quantity of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first doses or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; before trips that go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to catch the advice of his doctor since such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; the dose can be corrected both up and down , by turning the dose knob to the appropriate direction until the correct dose is compared to the dose indication . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or knots ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ anium deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic will take further medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( pseu@@ do medicine ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels lie in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients , which took Aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg , during the last three measurements have a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver function . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with heart problems in the previous history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mal deposits ( including a g@@ out node known from the medical history , and / or arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum quality level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other res@@ inous remedies , acute g@@ out attack can occur during the treatment , because the reduction of serum @-@ acid levels in the tissues can first be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for example , in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , read @-@ throat Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases thus increase so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ al Treatment and in the following course ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was no interaction studies done to F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line levels ( a hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous adoption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ ids 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
&quot; in a study with subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed capture of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and caused a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal @-@ experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or when performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the events reported by the investig@@ ator reported cardiovascular events compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
treatment related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , show@@ y EC@@ G , cou@@ ghing , short@@ ness , skin dis@@ col@@ oration , skin lesi@@ ons , bur@@ si@@ tis , prot@@ ru@@ sion of the potassium concentration in the blood , decrease in the concentration of TS@@ H in the blood , decrease of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
the active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ or , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg / l ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ; # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of serum quality levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and continued permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum concentration in subjects irrespective of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; data from the Phase 3 open extension study showed that less than 3 % of patients needed 16 @-@ 24 treatment for rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients no treatment for a de@@ g@@ assing ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in sight bur@@ r size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ utter no@@ des by month 24 . &quot;
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and were also received in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration were simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of serum concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at plasma protein binding is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly produced by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in urine was found to be un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , about 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to those with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mid @-@ total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 μ y yr / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ y yr / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
&quot; 12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ oma ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high dose treated group , in approximately 11 times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are considered as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproduction performance of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about 4,@@ 3 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , about 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human@@ ist exposure , did not reveal any ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that suggests that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , corresponds to exactly the dose required for the prevention of bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ) , driven abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic b@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd . , a permit for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be observed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oral ul@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; reactions such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ z@@ ations ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore be aware of all signs and symptoms that indicate possible allergic reactions , and patients should be cau@@ tioned to susp@@ end symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn medication and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not use the medicine properly and / or , after symptoms that indicate an un@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , continue to take . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly administered intraven@@ ously bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there is no data available which indicates whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a s@@ late surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , decreases in serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , oil sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of calcium and phosph@@ ate , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic people . &quot;

&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) decreased significantly after 15 weeks the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the average increases in BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % of the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to increase ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily continued either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo -@@ 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability gradually decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio @-@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 The distribution of rats showed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ances did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems in humans .

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity @-@ marked vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects was 2.4 % of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours , in the fa@@ ec@@ es after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the percentage of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it may be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with impaired ren@@ al function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with impaired ren@@ al function , there is a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , with the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or re @-@ recording of the di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and investigated how adv@@ ant is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , headache , nausea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time using Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the concur@@ rent medication should be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule part with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ sel bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring of a medical practitioner experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dose of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level regulations ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after adjustment . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as tal@@ low level , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated inspections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night@@ time planning phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the adv@@ ant can take several days until the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral in@@ gest@@ ing of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
the duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ant therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adap@@ tations can be necessary later as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may change after the transplan@@ t in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ant therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust must be converted to a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose , must take place . &quot;
&quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ ant once a day , the treatment with the oral initiation dose recommended in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection . &quot;
&quot; in adult patients , which are converted to adv@@ ant , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ as and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts , patients with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t therapy in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day were used in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood @-@ age levels in the targeted field may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
&quot; since the ren@@ al function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine vessels and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; when switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
recommendations on the level of tal@@ low in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the help of whole blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low @-@ mirror controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks of transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of tal@@ low in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the tal@@ low of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in cardi@@ - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring of a medical practitioner experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 On the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ arding formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
no clinical data for the ret@@ arding formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f is available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients .
&quot; taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and atten@@ u@@ ation of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood levels can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a canal or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , which can therefore also occur in advance . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , Adv@@ agra@@ ph Hart@@ kap@@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , L@@ act@@ ose contain particular caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhi@@ bit ; hence , the concur@@ rent application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is detri@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormon@@ al ex@@ positions , caution is particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that there is an increased risk of un@@ desirable events regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10@@ 000 , ≤ 1 /

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of B@@ Cs @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um- dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ inen ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks of the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) , and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were at 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Advanced and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of adv@@ ant and pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Advanced and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Advanced Arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) deaths occurred . &quot;
&quot; efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab @-@ antibody @-@ induction , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , at 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , loss of gra@@ ft , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up@@ - data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Advanced C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5,@@ 2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) ( 9@@ 5,@@ 2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Advanced Arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) death cases occurred . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily applied pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has become a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ as , lung and bow@@ el transplantation . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients transplan@@ t patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after a bow@@ el transplan@@ t , was used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported about 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was seen less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ lean and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , there occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients converted by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ t patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was administered to 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the target level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the dis@@ connected fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; this allows tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to be almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed prior to ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done by the bile . &quot;
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .

&quot; adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application are determined by whether adv@@ ant is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers them to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under 6 years , have been used to treat bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges was rated &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ances should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more until the pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment process , appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed in order to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should follow after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk is greatest within the first 20 expos@@ ures and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ c@@ ous ) inhibit@@ ors was observed in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia of known inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; in the largest number of patients A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , who had a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ke occurred post @-@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the plasma as well as the clearing rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in no 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients spor@@ adi@@ cally reported the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pro@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ids in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other IV products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co@@ factor for the activating factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were conducted in previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters originate from a cross @-@ over trial with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients alike or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation holder shall apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announces the Committee of Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for acquiring Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce any copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced by the p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells , if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs appeared in the area of the lower belly , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions he had asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors benefits patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ une @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when examining all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients receiving a@@ ero @-@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % reduction in symptoms compared to 26.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart disease or vascular disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ asis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , or have already had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval to the SP Europe company for the placing of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without sm@@ ashing it , breaking or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible , and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , resp@@ . within the 2 weeks after termination of such a treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is insufficient to address the dosage recommendations .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a@@ ero are not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is insufficient to address the dosage recommendations . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that treating hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be stopped . &quot;
&quot; care should be taken care of : • Pati@@ ents under digital@@ is • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze has to wait at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentrations of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the framework of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered . &quot;
&quot; the results of psych@@ om@@ otor testing showed no significant differences between the patients treated with either des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not it was used alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies resulted in no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness which may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ corneal pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , aging , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily was not an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine at recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences with regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city defined patient sub @-@ groups . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow@@ ability of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the all@@ ot@@ ation of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was for exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on conventional studies on the toxic@@ ity of toxic@@ ity and toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the contents pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ ra@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; March 2007 , and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drinking or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane of the ab@@ ject drug , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ab@@ sc@@ ess leading to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ ms in the medical history ( breathing difficulties due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys , or bladder . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases may occur or are diagnosed in the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; when applying at the recommended dosage , it is not possible to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or that the attention is reduced . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you miss the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the reported side effects will seriously adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this user information .
&quot; heart chase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , increased physical activity , redness , flus@@ hes , confusion , blur@@ red vision , dry eyes , nas@@ al infections , nas@@ al irritation , pain or difficulty in ur@@ ination , ur@@ inary retention , changes in the frequency of ur@@ ination , irritation , anxiety , anxiety and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous liver enzymes was also reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for inser@@ ting ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup and respectively . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ling , impairment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptoms ( symptoms of the symptom ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptoms after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a approval to the SP Europe company for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed once again .
&quot; in persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended for continuous treatment during the allergy period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not boo@@ sting the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness which may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was given in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was given over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ am@@ ines are a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the itch rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the overall seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentration of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing or is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at adi@@ n showed comparable degrees of exposure of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ ra@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dosage , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; colour@@ less film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ aria , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ t@@ ant absorption or in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not boo@@ sting the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
&quot; children aged 1 to 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dosis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the process of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults may be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not lead to any impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment as well as an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limiting metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose trial with the sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which metabol@@ ise severely . &quot;
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ wing bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling ranging from 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for inser@@ ting once a day in the mouth to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate dose can be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily , compared to those treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily was not an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable to the overall seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentration of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets once daily lay in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the processed tablets must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
effectiveness and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the dor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .

&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black people ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ sensitivity studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irritation tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation represents an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which metabol@@ ise severely , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ t@@ ant absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the placebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common side effects reported more often than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at a single dose of 2.5 mg of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no adverse events were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution for inser@@ ting the same concentration on des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n contains , no bio @-@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was separated from the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as foreign bodies ) , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient for assessing the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information on your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for use , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase should only be decre@@ ed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the probability of the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; as@@ er@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; using low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r medicine , A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with other protein inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / m@@ L compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; asthma also reduced the viral load in children , however , with children treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; patients with HIV , resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger anti @-@ viral load after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of asthma when used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs were out@@ weighed for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ generic pills should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking account of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than capsule , therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and Solution are not inter@@ changeable for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the ampli@@ fying additive from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ ur@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ stra@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking amp@@ a@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with asthma does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver irritation with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; because the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic effects with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if they are also given low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl glass content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other conditions for which drugs were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with medicines whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus can be examined and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan . &quot;
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are about 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the in@@ viol@@ able component of Di@@ dan@@ ov@@ ine it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is necessary . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs are to be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ virus might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dosage , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with azi@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100@@ mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole per day led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) on the 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or duc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interactions with other medicines , possibly resulting in interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with aspir@@ ation .
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can cause resor@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants , known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
&quot; simultaneous intake of as@@ gener@@ ase may significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma levels while ad@@ minist@@ ering as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these pharmaceuticals with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with the ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma levels are likely to increase by 3 to 4 times . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if they are also given low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose is to be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or ampli@@ fying anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the effect of supple@@ menting Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as a gener@@ ase dosage ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passing over into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
as@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment failure . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients as well as laboratory alterations ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre @-@ treated subjects treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one fall ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred normally during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable ; an exception was the rise in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed for signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ ein@@ ene stages with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the correlation between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients , who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 weeks , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 4@@ 1@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and the extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; firms that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ bol@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus ( one of 25 Isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ates ) appear . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates . &quot;
early depar@@ tures of a se@@ eding therapy are recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can affect subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ked &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis noted the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of an un@@ brid@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low d@@ osed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared with the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ brid@@ ged &quot; &quot; asthma should be considered in the treatment optimisation with children treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; after oral dosing , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; hence the minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the absorption of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , respectively a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be given with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ stra@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ ia exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules , so A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in dos@@ ages following the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro toxic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mutation testing ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of asthma or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed in systemic plasma exposure , which were significantly lower ( rats ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure . &quot;
&quot; 24 When A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the ampli@@ fying additive from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ ur@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the simultaneous application should be performed with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are about 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;

increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or ampli@@ fying anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol and 1,0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is observed for signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .

toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .

&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting was not documented neither with PI previously treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than capsule , therefore A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and Solution are not inter@@ changeable for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for inser@@ tion ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the concur@@ rent application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination may be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including A@@ gener@@ ase treatment does not prevent the risk of 47 from trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , are available for determining the drug concentration . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of acute ker@@ at@@ oses , it can be applied five times a week during one or two weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin@@ ly applied to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo treated either daily or five times a week .
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies , in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acoustic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can continue until all visible genital or perio@@ dicals are gone , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only in@@ completely cured , another therapy should be initiated ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is left out , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub into the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully c@@ anned . &quot;
in these patients it should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host response .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily bias was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ ture leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed even under proper use , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary bodily impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections for treatment of external in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital and perio@@ dicals is not yet clinical experience .
&quot; although limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ination reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients regarding the elimination of clin@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in case of super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the Li@@ ppen@@ heimer . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical locations outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the efficacy in this application , so such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take effect over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions give the patient a lot of discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - lesi@@ ons have a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although there is no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to use during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly shared and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related adverse events in trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of clin@@ chers ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort in the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
&quot; bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial , reported side @-@ by @-@ side , are shown below . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
adverse events indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream were listed below .
&quot; according to the clinical signs this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often show that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it often occurred with local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ ch@@ ori@@ ation / leaves / scales ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the clinical signs , this review shows that with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , severe corneal erosion ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , severe sc@@ aling ( 19 % ) were found in these studies . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg ion im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected following the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it could be shown that the effectiveness regarding a complete healing of the clin@@ chers at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior .
60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od totally healed the in@@ clin@@ ations ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks per week was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment times of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment times ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications Ultimate F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies involving children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low according to topical application on MC @-@ sick skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application for four months yiel@@ ded no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours to the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the non @-@ active cream , earlier and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will examine all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to operate Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient we@@ ars this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effects that occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which rehabilitation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience in resum@@ ing treatment after a prolonged period of inter@@ ruption , it must be cau@@ tious because of the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ka ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data in new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , is recommended , during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not breast@@ feeding . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the previous history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and facial o@@ ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe sl@@ ur@@ ry form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg IV once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patients aged under 5 years of age generally came to a serum trial ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not able to have antibodies against antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG levels in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ des a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients had the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and mobility , which is presented in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not statisti@@ cally significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of adult children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the g@@ amma @-@ level was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant up to the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in general , 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe delay ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe delay , only limited or no progress in cognitive development had to be determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test were carried out . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg IV once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in elderly and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity and unique ability to toxic@@ ity in repeated use and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ ion id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;

instructions for use - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient we@@ ars this , gradually increases to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the previous history , however , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and facial ede@@ ma occurred . &quot;
&quot; very common ( incidence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headaches • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin eff@@ usion • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ ton@@ ia • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole treatment in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti @-@ treatment &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood type changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , set or the dose can be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to a period of 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times compared to the comparable medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of necessary dos@@ - sis is taken out of the bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion of a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given the day before and during the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ pairing and the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ c@@ g ) a week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third action cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood count should be created prior to each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count . &quot;
&quot; the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the ne@@ di@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose duc@@ ts a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - in the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above , compared to patients aged 65 years , there is an increased side @-@ effect risk . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a h@@ ep@@ atic impairment of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or tran@@ sam@@ ic values of &gt; to the 3.6 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( if liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone and immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has once again reached a value of ≥ 100 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ tes , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non@@ mat@@ ogen@@ ic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia became be@@ o @-@ ba@@ ited if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before the therapy .
&quot; all patients who have a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ v treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 Sever@@ e cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible reduction of reproductive capacity exists through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment instructions to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ te ex@@ cre@@ tion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
care must therefore be taken when used in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed are avoided ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data concerning interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs are available with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the high in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; no data is available for use in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in the pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; mixed @-@ in may not be used during pregnancy , except if it is mandatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re mixed in breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma and the random@@ ised plat@@ inum and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 163 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive plat@@ inum as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients were random@@ ised to receive pha@@ sy @-@ mixed subjects including su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy trials ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of the liver function tests .

&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that performs its effect by interrup@@ ting metabolic processes , which are important for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to patients who were only covered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) related to the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in comparison with the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ized , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC was treated with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ pairing between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel are similar . &quot;
efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ abine in c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSCLC Hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transfer ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients were sel@@ - affected by Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed after administration as a mon@@ otherap@@ eutical were investigated in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ons over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine , within 24 hours of the application . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3,5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , sti@@ cky changes were observed ( de@@ genetic migration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; if not un@@ negoti@@ able , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; solve the contents of 100 mg / ml bottles containing 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring is ranging from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the product quality . &quot;
&quot; each bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
&quot; 23 Sever@@ e cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;

&quot; it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who are allergic to All@@ i and who do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot de@@ grade certain fats in the diet , thereby causing about a quarter of the fats that have been added to the food in@@ cor@@ related to the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a ≥ 28 kg / m2 BM@@ I , patients who received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco , fa@@ ec@@ es , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily stools , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( barrel ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it should also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited company to operate or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is insufficient data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function are not necessary to adjust the dosage . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a fat rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti @-@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who have all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international average @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials for up to 4 full years remained the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a single dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal adverse events were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of uncertain magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to Bek@@ le@@ mm@@ ungen in terms of possible and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
&quot; based on studies of humans and animals , a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects resulting from the li@@ mat@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic passages .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those students who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction in both studies was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average cholesterol in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin together with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration . &quot;

&quot; if you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in combination with a meal containing too much fat , you risk food @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule withdrawal with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
food di@@ aries are effective as you can track down what you eat as much as you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
&quot; to achieve your goal weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Gran@@ ts fatty acids to reduce the probability of diet @-@ related side effects ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking the capsules .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the reported side effects will seriously adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this user information .
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet at this time . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize dietary complications : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of you exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take it then in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial supplement , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Store away from the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • heart disease • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis , talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases . &quot;
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find on the packaging of foods . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should intake a maximum per day . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; see the information below which indicates the number of calories , which is suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , the adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; with the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss while reducing the chance of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to remove gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn down stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities daily . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily by moving , e.g. by 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minutes of garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a long @-@ term weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Essen@@ tial is a food diary with information regarding the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ ory and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight . &quot;
&quot; al@@ op@@ eci@@ es are used for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents binding a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 out of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ x showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the commerci@@ alisation of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in patients with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with an am@@ nesty or an indication of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous offering of p@@ alle@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy regi@@ men , Alo@@ xi should not be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agents investigated against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ t@@ dec@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience in the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician as necessary . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the resort ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage forms showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for a alo@@ of over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time : 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine , 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations , a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) generally are dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg with healthy patients and cancer patients .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that the total tex@@ position achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ off intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 metabolism of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron metabolism . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous captive bolt injection the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal eli@@ min@@ ation sh@@ ale and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after exposure , which are considered to be sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 The prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular deci@@ de@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ arization , and can pro@@ long the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times therapeutic exposure in humans ) , given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans to a unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this authorisation for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the drug approved in the context of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report recommen@@ ding the use of al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution intended for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C . &quot;
&quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon is supposed to resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ e@@ tics should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , and the liver enzyme Q@@ al@@ in- / Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood is also abnormal . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates these to form the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ I presented data that vali@@ dates the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ tics was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment had been treated ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ tics and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon , the disease was again reduced to more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ e@@ X@@ eon has had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanying with crust formation ) and small infected f@@ ences ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ liner @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not act against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients less than 18 years , the area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
&quot; in all five studies , the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( protein @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been prov@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weighed in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small inc@@ isions , abra@@ sions or se@@ wed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started . &quot;
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary infected wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations which have been reached in humans after topical application on abra@@ ded skin or infected superficial wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 Ac@@ cor@@ tical application of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on isolated skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement on effects on birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy should be continued / terminated with Al@@ tar@@ go , the benefit of breast@@ feeding should be considered for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the site of administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of con@@ rod mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ et@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ et@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding location of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Center .
&quot; by binding at this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should the local pre@@ valence of resistance apply the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some forms of infection , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in the case of non @-@ contact with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on isolated skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
specimens were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ oc@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic up@@ take of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver cells was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with small participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rats micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats indications of limited fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ inn@@ ed ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected . &quot;

&quot; irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if you are not specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment comes from sight on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice in case of discomfort . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years old , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix will be applied as part of a two @-@ dose @-@ existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose was administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if during imm@@ uni@@ zation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be put to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines act by &quot; teach &quot; the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambient contains the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Double , which has been approved since 1996 and has been registered since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of a three @-@ dose @-@ existing vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix left between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ ance may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered from six to twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vaccine is requested for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be ino@@ cul@@ ated . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ ologically competent persons , who have addressed a hepatitis B vaccine , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in no more prov@@ able antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 @-@ ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value is achieved , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal implant@@ ation , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ o@@ om@@ eration and preserv@@ ative formulation formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations in the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ines .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % compared to the administration of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ines .
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % of the subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ri@@ age was comparable to each pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % compared to the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and efficacy was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vacc@@ ines with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vacc@@ inations , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent@@ ine group was comparable to that which was observed with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per trial , was reported after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ inations that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum levels for anti @-@ ha@@ v 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the Ser@@ o@@ lic conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the rates of serum carot@@ ino@@ ids ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to that after ino@@ cul@@ ation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the fresh@@ ening of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ o@@ lic conver@@ sions as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ cu@@ tion on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is commonly transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete series of vacc@@ ines has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both V@@ acc@@ ine doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the point of departure ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
&quot; a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those in hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can result through it@@ chy skin erup@@ tions , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ alin @-@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose , and should give you / your child a vaccine before ending the vacc@@ ination series . &quot;
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child is subject to a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will receive / take other medicines ( including those you have received without prescription ) , or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated or has been given or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given or that is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many extre@@ mes as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; very common ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the set point or redness • Mat@@ ty • irrit@@ ability • headaches , lack of appetite &quot;
food frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 vacc@@ inated cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • F@@ ever ( over 38 ° C ) • Di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
&quot; further side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B , are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) were reported : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extended r@@ ashes that can it@@ ching or may be like bubbles , swelling of the eye area and face , ligh@@ tening at@@ mos@@ pher@@ es or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ sens@@ ations such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ants running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

&quot; 23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the reported side effects will seriously affect you / your child or you notice any side effects that are not specified in this package . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , on the basis of the data that has been known for placing the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split over several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nose tube ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , an abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , pal@@ pit@@ ations , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval for limited information about this drug . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which is manifested after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use if there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for growth and development . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children weighing over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is necessary in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day must be given to patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the origin of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat takes place via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , neur@@ onal multip@@ lication was slow@@ ed down and increased neur@@ on loss . &quot;
there was also a delayed stimulation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a hin@@ dran@@ ce to brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk by humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one unwanted event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
one case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an in@@ adver@@ tent single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle may be believed to be produced for each gram consumed sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % , but even with these patients , it was with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were re@@ covering from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined using a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single release and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; following different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was detected on the next morning after fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
&quot; according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no adverse effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets ) or have a gastro@@ scopy or nose tube .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children weighing over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is necessary in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat pipes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain bark occurred . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ ting excess
&quot; based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; for this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are absent , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accumulate after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding times , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headaches , taste problems , slow@@ ing of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant odo@@ urs , rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the reported side effects will seriously adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this user information .
you can no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cardboard box and the container .
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c foot ( tube which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose tube ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if Angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , Angi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bio@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it should also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
&quot; to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting attacks ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention , or early intervention planned . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an IV dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
an injection of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg is administered immediately before the procedure followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous pin allocation of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single dose of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before application and the dose dose should be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value falls below 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ as @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termin@@ ating the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• Fam@@ ous hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine @-@ active ble@@ ed@@ ings or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of ha@@ em@@ o@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ ologically is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of the ble@@ ed@@ ings of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture sites occur in the case of PCI patients , patients who undergo a sub@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform ble@@ ed@@ ings everywhere during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are using war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ ologically , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ in@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after dis@@ continuation of the treatment with bi@@ ologically reaches the prior treatment level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in each case , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ di@@ ase parameters are regularly controlled in combination with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; animal @-@ experimental studies are inadequate in relation to effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ k@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ k@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tioned he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; both in the biop@@ har@@ dy group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in treated comparison groups , adverse events occurred in women and patients over 65 years of age compared to male or younger patients . &quot;
severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and biop@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with biop@@ sy in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in treated comparison groups , adverse events occurred more frequently in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following adverse events , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ quit@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ quit@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on binding region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or t@@ ank@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the attachment of Bi@@ vali@@ k@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part re@@ generates the attachment of Bi@@ vali@@ k@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generates the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it was possible to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , bio@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following patients , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ k@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting attacks ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography in 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or that insulin cannot be processed effectively . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it has a faster effect and a shorter duration of action than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged four to 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin cra@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ ins or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin in patients can be reduced with a reduction in the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effective strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of manufacture can take a change in the need for insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment plan is changed .
&quot; substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ parts can be weakened or missing under the effect of symp@@ a@@ thetic symptoms such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the un@@ desirable compounds known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; cold wel@@ d@@ iness , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog @-@ ger , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will fail to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by a doctor &apos;s intraven@@ ous administration of glucose . &quot;
&quot; after a co@@ ag@@ ulation injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ly normal insulin analog .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ all@@ tus , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional and glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ induc@@ ing effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin , and has the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ aving effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin . &quot;
&quot; the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin was swal@@ lowed in 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative control was achieved than with a human insulin analog that was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the meal begins , comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved like with human insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ ds before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at administration 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
