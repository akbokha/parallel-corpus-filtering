<seg id="1">"this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of hot tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. entertain thoughts and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disturbance, a mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexic elation) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat mild to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be used for inserting or using the urinary tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are degraded just like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably appears primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, however, has a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its occurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, preventing the recurrence of symptoms, was studied in three trials over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients suffering from bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest associated with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the patient's symptoms based on a standard bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to study how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for taking out (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, in four of the five short-term studies, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in addition, Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled sugars), acathema (drowsiness), drowsiness, nausea, drowsiness, insomnia (sleep disturbance) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from severe to severe manic episodes in patients who were predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazole, were outweighed against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and related their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoteric and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyninesia: in clinical trials that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia treated with Abilify should be considered, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be discarded."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist family, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, however, this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chines) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisations."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem (Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethylan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethylan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy due to the insufficient data storage for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="71">"the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and its occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by combining a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro aria piprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor, as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing of 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"Aripiprazole also showed in week 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium and haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks for manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to the prevention of bipolar recurrence, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and Hydroxymethylation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkyness is catalysed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean time of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolisations via CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolisations via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects."</seg>

<seg id="93">"a single dose trial in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impact of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-onset carcinomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average stop-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubula and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="303">"this stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions."</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transcytosis of plasma components is mediated into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transsendothelial transport is mediated through the gp-60-albuminescence receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor appears due to the albuminated protein acidic rich in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-handed unrelated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylurea and insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea and insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, enabling type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,400 patients, the effectiveness of acetone in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea showed a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c value, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a lowering of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took additional placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypocritical (decreased sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos can neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients when metformin is not indicated.</seg>

<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"when examining all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients receiving aero-aze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared with 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"when only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, patients under Aerinaze showed a 37.4% reduction in symptoms compared to 26.7% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence, sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>

<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a approval to the SP Europe company for the placing of aerinaze in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without smashing it, breaking or chew)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">"due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible, and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine over time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"as aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the drug is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, resp. within the 2 weeks after termination of such a treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, lisurid, cabergoline, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is insufficient to address the dosage recommendations.</seg>

<seg id="1683">"the harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experience from a large number of affected pregnancies resulted in no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be applied during pregnancy."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report recommending the use of alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution intended for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that alpheeon is supposed to resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference medicinal products" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alphetics should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage damages, and the liver enzyme Qalin- / Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood is also abnormal."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene (DNA), which stimulates these to form the active substance."</seg>
<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of AlpheI presented data that validates the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alphetics was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients."</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment had been treated (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alphetics and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheeon, the disease was again reduced to more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, AlpheXeon has had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine) is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection accompanying with crust formation) and small infected fences (crack or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicilliner-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not act against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but in patients less than 18 years, the area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">"in all five studies, the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with Hautwunden, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (protein-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been provably or presumably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo were outweighed in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small incisions, abrasions or sewed wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued a approval to the Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the placing of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary infected wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations which have been reached in humans after topical application on abraded skin or infected superficial wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 Accortical application of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the medium retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on isolated skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement on effects on birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"in deciding whether breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy should be continued / terminated with Altargo, the benefit of breastfeeding should be considered for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which used Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the site of administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of conrod mutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeterianus (formerly Pleurotus passeterianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding location of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the PeptidyltransferaseCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding at this binding site, pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should the local prevalence of resistance apply the application of Retapamulin at least some forms of infection, advice should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of retinapamulin to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the case of non-contact with S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"absorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on isolated skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"from 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">Specimens were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before mediocation and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic uptake of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 skinned skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor."</seg>
<seg id="2709">"metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver cells was mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats micro-core test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">"there was neither male nor female rats indications of limited fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 skinned):"</seg>
<seg id="2713">"in an embryotoxicity study of rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were detected."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years old, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix will be applied as part of a two-dose-existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose was administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if during immunization there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be put to an end."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by "teach" the immune system (the natural defences of the body) as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"ambient contains the same components as the vaccine Twinrix Double, which has been approved since 1996 and has been registered since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix and Twinrix are administered as part of a three-dose-existing vaccination plan."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix left between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month and a 12-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) and irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"ambiance may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for priming with Ambirix consists of two doses, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered from six to twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher vaccine is requested for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be inoculated."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured whether immunologically competent persons, who have addressed a hepatitis B vaccine, need a refresher vaccination as protection, as they may be protected by immunological memory even in no more provable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360-ELISA units of formalin-activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in case of haemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value is achieved, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal implantation, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"for thrombocytopenia or blood coagulation disturbances, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"if Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"in patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomoomeration and preservative formulation formulation."</seg>

<seg id="2759">"however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per trial, was reported after vaccination with Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccinations that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose-vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose-vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">"in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum levels for anti-hav 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7)."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or that insulin cannot be processed effectively."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it has a faster effect and a shorter duration of action than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged four to 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in the case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin craper."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulins or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin in patients can be reduced with a reduction in the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the effective strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of manufacture can take a change in the need for insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment plan is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, Pentoxifyllin, Propoxyphene, Salizylates and Sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>

<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or by a doctor's intravenous administration of glucose."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a coagulation injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than with hu- manly normal insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes malltus, insulin-lulisin in therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional and glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosa-inducing effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"insulin lulisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin, and has the complete glucosesaving effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandial glycaemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
