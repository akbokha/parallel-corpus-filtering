&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some features from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to access . &quot;
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings to set up enh@@ ancements .... Click the Tools menu and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de package . add@@ ons . please note that more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install k@@ de@@ base package containing &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; click on Extras shut@@ down . then you can view the page that has brought to crash , or the list of crashes if any . &quot;
the In@@ sight Filter module ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras In@@ sight Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can filter the current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files , even then easily detected , can be recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is present . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always maintained . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and these parameters need space which is no longer available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses by frame , so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View View@@ ing with area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application . &quot;
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users here . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also check the digi@@ code ; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to join &amp; digi@@ plug ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions to announce in the developer mailing list from &amp; signed ; . &quot;
&quot; if you are editing &amp; editing ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ plug , you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder , the images , as a base folder . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ hit ; it scans the library path in its entirety . you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can do this by placing a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera ; then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can be digi@@ ti@@ sed ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help shell camera support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ .@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; together . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras distinguish themselves by using Compact and Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras , which supports a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras , also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images can be read by digi@@ BO@@ ware . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to complete a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drawing and dropping images works everywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this icon view is also displayed . which fields can be displayed , you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ eper ; provides an organized view to your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ hit ; these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ dos or after the date on which the album was first created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select an album to scan im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to include information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and edit album properties in the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method of selecting your albums so that you can be group@@ ed together under a common name . by choosing from the tool bar , you can select the collection from the tool@@ bar or sort view Albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by Date .
&quot; the buttons older , average , new : they set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture on the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ eper . this should help you remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may then want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the contex@@ tual menu &amp; quot ; As an album template . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; support the entry of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these previ@@ ews with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you must wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information is this , you can change the settings in digi@@ ti@@ sed ; set up the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window which appear . if you leave the mouse po@@ inter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the key words of a photo . the screen shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image processing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to it . you can reach all the functions that can be edited with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you have the choice between viewing the pictures , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by pressing F@@ 4 Image Edi@@ ting ... or editing the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... editing . in the editing section , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to adapt it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . this information will be lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way is to click the preview and select &quot; &quot; Rot@@ ate &quot; . &quot; in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ hit ; delete it , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer really del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&amp; quot ; My dat@@ um@@ eli@@ gi@@ ver ; organis@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available the date of the last change of the file .
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; tags include a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a cue has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ cking ; folding , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords when losing the database are re @-@ imported as soon as digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images are noted . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then select New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the under@@ statement of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a cue by right @-@ clicking on the keyword and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the cue will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and selecting keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail to preview the pictures and select keyword entries from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords to it assigned keywords . in this way , you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows you the keywords , which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection box that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated pictures in the main window .
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; ne@@ aring search box is a small lamp that will find green if the search finds matches . if you click here , the filtering will be cleared and all images will be displayed again . if search has not found , then the lamp will rot . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit a search , the search appears again with the search information entered . if you choose to edit as an advanced search , the advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu . &quot;
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ .@@ s database .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Search database . all rules are displayed in line with the search group / search group . one option can be added to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... , you can create search of the type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ THING . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : hand @-@ handed paint sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ plug ; find the right pictures . here too a threshold value can be set .
this tab sets an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can move in or out or move it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all pictures inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window opened . if you are back in the editing pane ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras be@@ acon . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you preview a preview of the tool@@ bar and carry out a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , they will also be executed with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to display fast from a series of images . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the areas to compare . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal del@@ e@@ tion operations also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the main window of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can recognize on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you have to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
zoom in the same way as in other views . simply use the zoom slider under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into The Picture and zo@@ oming out . this happens in both images if you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the preview mode .
digital stock management considers every part of the process following the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your images again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , organize , group , archive , optimize , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , search , transform , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data that is managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use determined not &amp; digi@@ ti@@ cked ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats freely . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer . you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough pictures , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend checking the metadata in the metadata in the file &apos;s settings page ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change that ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should now assign cap@@ tions , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at the next work . &quot;
&quot; let us now with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ hit ; automatically insert the tree for you bz@@ w the pictures to the right place . sorting the tree within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you want to share your photos with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming , have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help Him on the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a let@@ tering for itself to work alone .
&quot; you can use it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your requests in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story for the publication again . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navig@@ ational system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels via images with geographical indications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent freelance photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique each image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will be available in the near future to provide such a module for batch processing .
&quot; topics : record errors , plate failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it lies in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good discs and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheaper ones , but you write much more reliably . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; it works under Windows and Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications for damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs is , of course , also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; slowly burn with a good capture device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ oc@@ re format . after that , read the data again to check you . also , should you copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
disc@@ othe@@ ques retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ts include a new disk but not data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
&quot; some of S@@ MA@@ RT errors are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the imminent failure . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not account much , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed process processors . these can cause serious damage . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and ear@@ ns the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure to comply with the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and keep the system sorted out . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be paid for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; compared to the hard drives at home , however , you are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you should open a photo and this to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly concerned about transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use the Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebooks and 46 % for work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer have been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limitations . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for data loss . so , save your data frequently on a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous such as re @-@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , hit a flash you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time that such a backup has been made .
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between the files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase the security via ss@@ h . &quot;
save important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the same time you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , stored in the image file , stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original store , storage , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , view@@ devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time period you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is now available to everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and you want to expand the area you want to expand to a dedicated plate or partition . * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted reside / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; # works with ext@@ 2 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression . &quot;
TI@@ FF has been widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ ine ) but requires very large files .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open shell format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and obliged to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; -@@ Technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive the original of your image , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems to link between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI activities include the work on an architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera service , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ g ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these may be cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . simply export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ .@@ In section adding a photo to an album , you will find a description on how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the connection is made , a ready -@@ indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; tab metadata displays internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer note , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all . this invites all the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . downloading the pictures is not deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album , before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected download button is gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not yet been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; downloaded . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums will be displayed , as usual folder . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; More ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you must select it first , and then delete the selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos are not moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera . if you want to delete the camera bug , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use not particularly meaningful names as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos . the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names , if you upload photos from different shooting galleries into the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this last option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission , three other options open before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two are related to the author in the Standard Auto Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing area . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case when downloading . or in capital letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window for the next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic spin during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , it can be done &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; these sub @-@ albums are automatically loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub@@ woofer option at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog box &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder here and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position specified in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude dig@@ its and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O , or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or want to send users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the em@@ blem of ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the editing dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview , or start image editing . you create the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main screen . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for fas@@ cia : this field should be the professional title of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save image cap@@ tions as embedded in@@ scriptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the cur@@ sor is in the main window above a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ code , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be set back by clicking the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lamp from &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only get better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this viewing mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling refers to the fact that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation .
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TI@@ FF file option , you can comp@@ ress the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF image . it does not affect image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the image editing was only one picture viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensors react with more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd rows , this difference produces a little bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . default is to use a solid color balance , based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images receive more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the spot@@ lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned in , due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as a continuous white . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast satur@@ ating as green and red . &amp; digi@@ code ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still unused blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ invo@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data , which comes from the color filtered image sensor , which many cameras have and which provides a matrix color pixels . &quot;
&quot; after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ide Direc@@ ted ) was the quality for me and the paper used . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dation correction , since it is performed during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to how to return it . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ code ; information such as the colour information from a color space in the other are to be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image processing , start color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der S@@ link here to the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot;
&quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; not all profiles are built in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print a picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not on Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon &apos;s profile expansion lets you recognize the style for the destination : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Portra@@ it@@ and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug can support ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings &quot; &quot; Options &quot; . &quot; &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties are shown on the left @-@ hand side of a list of cameras supported at the time . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which attempts to identify a camera attached to the computer . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can manually set the camera model and port . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s C@@ ameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option Con@@ trac@@ ting dialog for moving &gt; ima@@ gery in the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly accepted by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; applied if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also disable &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the screen &apos;s welcome screen ; under certain circumstances , this will speed up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the start process . &quot;
&quot; setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos forces &amp; digi@@ plug ; search the base folder for new or deleted records / photos ; this length@@ ens &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed the start time ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ hit ; you decide whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you will find more information in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button to preview a picture or by selecting the entry / edit entry .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ code ; you may not be part of your distribution . more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image editing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the upper edge , and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using from the File Recovery or Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last save . &quot;
virtually any image editing operation can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting Edit Rück@@ le and Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to remember . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; for a moment longer using the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between are revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
&quot; you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l , mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the actual menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select En@@ large factor &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can edit this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug ; view it from the editing dialog ; see the section for setting up the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; complete picture preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the Album Export Printing Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; editing ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available , without the navigation file , also available in the image processing . it will be displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same tab allows the side bar to appear or disappear into the margins again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC ann@@ ot@@ ation field in other applications you should consider these limitations .
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the button Apply or simply change to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to using the user button , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; session applied keywords . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another convenience when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keywords tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the section Key@@ word Fil@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - date , keyword and search views is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and store keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is limited to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asked if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button . the options then look like this : &quot;
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow fulfil@@ s all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular area . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB indicates that your ; on@@ itor works on s@@ RGB . if you are working as a s@@ RGB colour space , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting to proceed manually .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Adju@@ st@@ ment and Con@@ trast extending from the Cor@@ rec@@ tional Automatic Cor@@ rection menu automatically try to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lamp values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot would be as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous factor in the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes , the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest possible range and a re@@ modelling of all values in between . this is only visible when images are washed out and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is a little restricted as a color space with 8 bits per color is used . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original white balance again , just click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the right top , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynamically change once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or di@@ mming down . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance to the pre @-@ settings list . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; save as and load the buttons as and load exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set , you can save it into a text file and load it again later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under Color sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for several photos simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will therefore always need the same correction . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under paints gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; editing &amp; editing ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that emerged when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently in@@ vert the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . finally , another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar panel effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition by &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via &apos;s strongly saturated colors are also a few phot@@ ograph@@ ers especially those whose barely landscapes agree .
&quot; the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders repeat the thickness of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
&quot; if you are doing a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple ch@@ amma @-@ thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide . concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph three slider are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle one for the light tones and the lowest for the middle frequencies , often called Gam@@ ma@@ zes . &quot;
&quot; the three colour twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input of shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output rate inter@@ actively as in the input evaluation . for example , the compression of the output rate can be used to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is visible in the background . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the entran@@ ces applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half the original and target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel to be changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most sensible . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode produces a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short section to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels disappear . &quot;
&quot; if you want to move this marker to the area that you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on that line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons , you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
editing &amp; editing channel mixers ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel Mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first clu@@ e how to correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison with your own tab .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are shown right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix up mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . colour space consists of small noise arti@@ facts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by improving the color space first . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Download buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you later , and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . preserving the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film si@@ ghting with a green lens filter . this looks good in all scenes and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky .
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film si@@ ghting with an orange lens filter . this improves scen@@ eries , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film si@@ ghting with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate moon scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film si@@ ghting with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; this is very similar to the process of escap@@ ing a pressure and re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother , and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or tri@@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed below ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly en@@ circles the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a bone effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After adjusting the aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you choose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template can apply , you can put a template over a picture . &quot;
the Picture template can be used in the image processing can be used to create templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . you must , however , take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the template , simply send an email to the &amp; digi@@ code ; email list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically . &quot;
the preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces fine @-@ gra@@ ined images especially in dark areas . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . in fact it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ audiovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for custom@@ ization .
&quot; images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to one color point . this , in turn , results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more later sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to focus with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t Schär@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; you should be careful , however , as the results do not seem to be very natural : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ cia V@@ ist@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Spam is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase of the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask to strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined to be applied to an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from shar@@ per , and therefore plastic fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . non @-@ sharp mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected det@@ our filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focusing achieves usually better results than blur@@ ring . you can start it from the menu by focusing colors re@@ focusing in image processing .
&quot; the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixels . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s fold is even heavily influenced by the pixels . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is pal@@ atable . in most cases , you should leave this value to zero to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the sharp@@ ness of the gau@@ ges . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all cutting , colour and intensity correc@@ tions before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ering produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by har@@ sh@@ ing blur@@ ring a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; even under optimal conditions , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture must be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the method for correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator smooth@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the area that was dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the colour ink allows an appropriate colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ cub@@ ator was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ing over the picture . whereas larger values are chi@@ ef@@ ly smooth@@ ed and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the detail maintenance should always be subject to the direction depen@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD rus@@ hing , a high value sha@@ kes wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best corrected at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ s &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above every@@ th@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value little 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel @-@ smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to let it out . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Save as &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ad &quot; &quot; buttons make exactly this . correc@@ ting any image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; correct image errors is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how to remove image errors with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Inter@@ pane advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area specified by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller faults . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or for@@ ging will occur again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter frequency response . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise spi@@ kes can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically more ru@@ stling .
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase suppression . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter range responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system , and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ cia V@@ ist@@ ers and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ atures , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce art@@ ef@@ acts : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting shall correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Save as &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ad &quot; &quot; buttons do exactly this . any photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera onto an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie grain on the faces .
&quot; below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo , which was read by a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ light and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem to remove eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all previous areas .
&quot; select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters that are available : &quot;
&quot; average : an average of the neighboring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ code editing ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool for correc@@ ting the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , in particular those in medium and large photo formats , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead , &amp; quot ; vibr@@ ate it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise incre@@ mental effects may arise by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ mic and color gra@@ dient fields of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of an Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that has been made without this filter . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controls , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damp@@ ing at the point of the highest density the filter . the default density is 2,0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a lens aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image processing from the menu Color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth gra@@ dient correc@@ ts the distant corners towards the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally : this value controls the thickness of the second layer &apos;s distortion . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade . this value appears more strongly in the margins than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby correc@@ ts the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
&quot; ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the Ton@@ nen@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . ideally , you perform this correction as first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing or using the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as recording from front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the sound @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org website which is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Fun@@ ge Movie Cor@@ ners option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel , it makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; this is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ arity on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix big silver grains of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ hit ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one chooses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush is better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the lines , which define the outline in drawing , are emphasized . images of whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start with . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size , and the lower one adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engra@@ ver shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : similar to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels by a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photographs taken from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focusing effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the picture by shifting the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
smart blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows changing the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ pfen , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or rotating . you can find the tools in the menu Trans@@ forming Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming mirrors . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools , in order to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality . &quot;
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses a more developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; retained aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Save as &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Lo@@ ad &quot; &quot; buttons are used for this purpose . enlarge Every single @-@ st@@ all@@ tion for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo magni@@ fication by enlar@@ ging a small image to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . previ@@ ew@@ ing ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement compared .
&quot; cro@@ pping a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . in order to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The Custom Button of image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save or File Save file under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area to cut to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the setup guide settings allow you to fade in , so you can better compile your images . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic divi@@ dings are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ bows , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to build your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden separation in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . &quot;
the golden centre provides more fluid assistance lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition results in the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center @-@ points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . &quot;
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic crop function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the spin . however , please note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
corner right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get immense tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformation trimm@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , the upper part of the picture will shift to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two insul@@ ations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has blur@@ red tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transformation trimm@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; More . &quot;
&quot; because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries , it is impossible to add a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; only shows files in formats that you know . this is done by file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file will be edited ; you can change this list of file extensions , which can be changed . in the configuration section , you will find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras may even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; More ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less if it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour , very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ plug . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the website of Dave Coff@@ in . &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to view or edit films .

many tools you need to learn the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ plug ; contain . your description follows here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft sign , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture per quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
&quot; vertically , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left panel shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview range . &quot;
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range . &quot;
the left panel shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper part shows the original and the lower part to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview section , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated instantly .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab sets an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can move in or out or move it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all pictures inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can apply either to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the palette view . here , too , the color name can be changed . &quot;
&quot; it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;

&quot; other required software : &amp; k@@ gra@@ vey@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &apos; dot &apos; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently selected file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ rep@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; instance or display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it using the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later . &quot;
you can also set how the graph is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely cho@@ osen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one page distributed across multiple pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the refresh page gives the option to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time . &quot;
opening the page opens the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
page session management gives you the option to set the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ rep@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s of directional graph@@ s . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ app@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for wei@@ ghted graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring model for un@@ structured graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s . &quot;

reading the K@@ IP@@ I module frames provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to be able to replace the default duc@@ ting custom to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the scan button , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . &quot;
screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected the Im@@ porting &gt; Screen Photo ... menu . a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen settings :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a brief delay , you will read the currently visible job . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show your photos to the people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is thus virtually your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can register at Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful login , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will see the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; if the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other authori@@ z@@ ations . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button &quot; &quot; Add photos &quot; &quot; should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server will start . &quot;
&quot; the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words , which are added to the image as keywords during the upload . &quot;
&quot; with the options Open , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly , you can adjust the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered with Maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie export is a tool to export your collection of images to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie export currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image , and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization makes tools available for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization corridor . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and click the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to run a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time , and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time vari@@ ance is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have track data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ er and difference in min can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog itself coordinates the coordinates from a call to the next , you only have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Lead it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be manually selected between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ gen@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Picture Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums to be exported as HTML pages , and set the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the tab has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the Ri@@ der selection allows to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab design@@ ates the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page opens in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated pictures . for this , select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which of course also affects file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are shown in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user as far as the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ aus@@ ages . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown as default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses in quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size rises because there is no compression of the color information . for example , this can also be found in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . &quot;
this function does not work on all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you first need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can start using Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module . &quot;
&quot; the pictures selected by you are then listed under picture files in the portfolio . there , you can also change sorting of the pictures or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to re@@ play the file on a TV , you must choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that displays a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file using the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , it is integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button . &quot;
&quot; if there is a hint that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck programs using the Settings button below . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module directly .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s command @-@ line tool . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image format , TI@@ FF , retains all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently , or otherwise use them otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the option to over@@ write existing files . this is helpful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using the button Add images . for the last image selected , a preview will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the list of images and place them in order to add you to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected pictures will be removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after you have selected all the pictures you can click OK to open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to sending too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the P@@ NG file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original export data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for bugs . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . pressing the Lock button allows you to close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window appears with questions about how to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all the pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
&quot; the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . afterwards , you can manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not used in the order of the images in the album . &quot;
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitions between which you can select . random@@ ly chooses a different effect from each transition between the images .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting up an image as a background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop interface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can play with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , entries are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have input information as you have provided your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images on which both people are displayed will be shown . by using this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your area of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but for each person you can save your own preview image , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; to view images in addition to the names , select the button which is on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . &quot;
&quot; however , you must decide which image to see for each individual . in order to do this you will need to open the image preview window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the contex@@ tual menu . in the screen window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you start searching in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog again on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you wish , you can also enter a date you want to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then shows another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview button ) , and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following section of the user manual the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described .
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the flash and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer , even without description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically explained . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means those who have a look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so , he can browse your images with low resolution , resulting in a lower transfer time . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the root folder where all your pictures are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically updated for the next time . you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , correctly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; all three settings that have just been described have moved to base folders and URLs . in this folder , a sub@@ folder will be created , the name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time recording the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even make this work one more time . &quot;
with &amp; k photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it scans the images , which are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you have created while creating the HTML files will be only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
&quot; to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with option Automati@@ cally Cop@@ y to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum picture size . if you send images to your friends , you might want to send the images not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the file import ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in the description . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is named with your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked what categories of imported file should be imported and what categories they correspond in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to see images of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will see the various steps of ( 1 ) set of information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used automatically for future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album , set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings will be explained . &quot;
&quot; to the left , you will see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is provided , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can set various properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up full member groups , i.e. all members of a group are set up at once in a group rather than all groups of a group@@ ed as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
&quot; modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules have been tested with one another . therefore , you should first test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures you see at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , we have to release a list of albums as well as a list of albums . here we go &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you set in Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , you will do so , so if you have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your picture database . &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture where the image has been recorded and so on . for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all images recorded in Copenhagen .
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text field by defining individuals , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as you can always use them whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , therefore , move the names used up , to find and assign persons faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the before and back buttons below the picture to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S. , and San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as a group . to show you that it is a group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category in the comment dialog context menu . in addition , you can also simply drag an item to a category and place it to a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the l@@ ath , which form the upper edge of the frame , and move it . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside of the window range . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... , which offers among other things the possibility to store the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then window in / out window . see this procedure in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and select either the Del@@ ete key or select Edit selection from the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use the images somewhere , so you can record the images somewhere , so you can record them in the database index . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures where the right upper corner is truncated is not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nail pictures are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if so , don &apos;t support it until now you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the CD . so if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger disk to store all the pictures on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little bit more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end those you want to make accessible to others and click on Ac@@ tual View menu bar . alternatively , you can also use all the pictures that your little sister can see , to control everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so that all the pictures you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click lock on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , everyone can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , read the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this type of password protection is only used to forbi@@ d those who are with &amp; k photo@@ album ; not very familiar to obstruc@@ t the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is equipped with an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries to this display . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the p@@ ush@@ button picture high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new picture can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you use the viewer , you can move in the image and zoom out . you can zoom into the picture with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation button sets the zoom so that each pixel on the screen is a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out , with the plus and minus button . &quot;
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to mark pictures with characteristics as you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature in that you press the corresponding letter . in this you see an image , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , they are available in the browser . you can see this in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply put them all at once with notes . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you have categories in In@@ dre Pre@@ view view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the mark after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to exit the painting mode of &amp; k photo@@ album , select on the painting from the contex@@ tual menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you need to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views is shown in yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object already selected , as all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu In@@ sert . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with a fault description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and then click on Apply or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross in the wire model view will appear . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object , or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply change between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the first to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle will show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , pull the Beg@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map Le@@ aders above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to remove a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... Save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon ( Ren@@ dering The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; render mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you want from a fast preview to full @-@ screen images . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
in the quality combination you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection illumination . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this feature see better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects to P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling involves the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is always separated and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ess depth depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , a grid of 4x4 incre@@ ments will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are separately followed and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; diff@@ use light reflection calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams did not hit any object .
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly terminated , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene import , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can also insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on help in the property view , it opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; if you include files that are not in the folder &apos;s folder , you will also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the check@@ points selected .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ type view . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the wall , a wall is rendered back behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern in two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the ground , a ground beneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you check channel smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders you will be able to create and store windows orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
any window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the button Del@@ ete .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you will anchor the window under the existing window , with card map you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a sphere on one level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you will get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert lights , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have everything installed correctly you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and icons many times , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . now you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wi@@ re@@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the scene &apos;s ren@@ der@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the description camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera &apos;s target point . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the Apply button or push button button , the wire model views and the object tree change instantly according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End User Qu@@ aders ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the button bar . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also displays the level , although at the moment only a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon , just to get to know some of these parameters . &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , where you can select how the object should be inserted . please choose first sub@@ item . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the preview button , you can see how the pigment is now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you can still type settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on the button and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes . in the color list , you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the check@@ er@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should simply execute this step , since you should have understood the basic way of working from &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . the ball is just as easy to create as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the button or button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor around one unit to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the sphere a pigment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ item and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you and k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the rendering hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams shoot from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you &apos;ve previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Rück@@ le .
&quot; stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or over@@ write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here , you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change the short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
&quot; a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces , without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface separately and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for both a dump @-@ map and a texture map .
basic objects are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in your own window in the image size or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the return key can be displayed .
&quot; you can choose to see if each image is to be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first characters of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . the next start will open &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so you can set up only some of the file types that the program can display .
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . pres@@ etting is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cut keys for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display grid and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .

&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; image editing based on the &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ code ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; this is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
the best start to join &amp; show@@ shot ; to join it is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&quot; there are many options that change the behavior of the show@@ shot . to access these settings , you have to select the settings in the Settings show@@ down menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to display . exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of the show photo ; has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can display them in which you click on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; channels ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; -@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . for each image , you can open a dialog for saving or save the images instantly in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE website by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command channel l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; in order to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview display in the settings , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and shot ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , Before saving , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this option allows them to select the kind as and channels ; images save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; how@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically be saved with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically @-@ storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you choose not to select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help will start the K@@ DE Help with the Ch@@ ange@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over dialog for and channels ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit .

&quot; you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting &quot; &quot; Set short commands ... &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you may need to set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok and short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features which are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not work . &quot;

&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and steer Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continually monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure sel@@ ects the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece query ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volume Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) to remove an entry . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . basically , such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can optionally also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension cat@@ amar@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . perhaps you will also find only a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you have already a few play@@ lists , but you can never decide which ones to listen to ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard to make , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew ! &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have any trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be enabled or disabled at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activate de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; add mood files to music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok , should be started when a browser is required . &quot;
&quot; using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
&quot; when you want to save a playlist , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists contain relative paths : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files based on the location of the playlist . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
keeping the current piece visible during piece change means that the playlist pop@@ s / un@@ rolls to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
&quot; when changing to a context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting Custom Writ@@ ing , the otherwise grey outlined section is activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; resume playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the place where it has been stopped at the last exit . &quot;
&quot; set up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors do not apply , the default colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment is supposed to appear on the O@@ SD . &quot;
the box audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers enable even more settings in this card card .
&quot; the Cart@@ ridge collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of the database for the collection . &quot;
&quot; here you can select the folder , which is intended to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
search sub@@ directories recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import Play@@ lists : cause &amp; Amar@@ ok , add all the found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the playlist browser . &quot;
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected you need further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m al@@ loc@@ ates support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send off played pieces and update the profile : this option allows &amp; Amar@@ ok , to send the names of the pieces played to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
call the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ ed@@ .@@ or@@ g. Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and you can also delete the file that caused the crash .
&quot; most of the time , this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a news from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of the compiled libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace the error will be guaranteed .
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use mp3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times before this setting has shown its effect . &quot;
if you get this mistake : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ 200@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are most easily solved by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . they can also help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ ek@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one mistake there if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show Review . click anywhere in the new review column to set the review for one piece . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file into the playlist with the mouse and let it fall there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the button can be saved . click on it . &quot;
probably the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config program is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual ; this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( right @-@ click ) . in addition , you can find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / MAS / K@@ DE@@ V ? . as you see , we support virtually any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng ! &quot;
&quot; you may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent law reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Package Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok in advance ! ) : - Download , compile and install ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all the ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the list register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; if you have a list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good .
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command makes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to bed . &quot;
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on a different computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your user name . this assumes your identification is in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right click is a piece in the click order in the queue . by pushing the button to a search in the playlist the first search result will be played back and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control Panel ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( Esc@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can change the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece just as all the other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece with the right mouse button . you can edit the rating also in the Met@@ adata dialog . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan of not bringing together Amar@@ ok &apos;s scheduled plan .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar to set up ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text @-@ Browser Design , click New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid any difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor and control Amar@@ ok , while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably got &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
&quot; now I have installed and Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules do not yet appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you must now install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same is true for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad needs to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module . &quot;
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then execute it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; set up Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one . &quot;
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w : 1 } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check mark on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio @-@ output with Arts won &apos;t be looked after . you may naturally want to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new much @-@ needed super@@ visor for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you don &apos;t like your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop items from the collection browser into the playlist . if you are satisfied with the playlist , the tree view will immediately save the remaining matching entries . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own playlist , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , you can find these play@@ lists already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply right @-@ click on an entry and follow the Bur@@ n menu . here you have various ways to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installing some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages will be listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; and Amar@@ ok , is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok control center . at the top of the window there is a scroll bar displaying the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining play time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including running text . you can change by using the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the button with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zer .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback , and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pre @-@ settings , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create own pre @-@ settings . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok , is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; in the navigation area , you will find some of the most excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there are now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statisti@@ cs window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title , you will find the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information on the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation .

&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for connection between &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be mounted in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer ordered in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired tracks from the playlist and let them fall on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . as a result , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transmission is complete , you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar contains a search field that you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick music from a given URL . for example , if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and push input key , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simple dropping . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location and drop . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by spaces , you will search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you type one in two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This search for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR Match : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment pool .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number is the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you would have called for each project file . &quot;
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project it is asked what to do so as if you would have called file closing .
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select files for adding to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are dra@@ gging the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to run the Medi@@ ums . the Bur@@ n dialog can only open if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is this ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project .
this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium ; it only hides the previously imported files .
&quot; alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the usual copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . &quot;

( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for an * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; When an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view will display an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key assignments for it further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in function range , so your taste and the type of your task will be crucial . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as cop@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; it is easy to read audio CD ; read it out and save it to MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also , other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble across in the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; pick up information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is collected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of the main window commands . on the Step @-@ by @-@ step example , you will find further information on how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB query of CD data starts in accordance with the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be made . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the Code coding Settings in the setup directory - the encoding .
&quot; a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with another enco@@ der can be read as the default . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der was configured in the Settings dialog in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read out , and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog for the type of notification ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; stopped ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here you must go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression advice and helps you choose the correct enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good Gen@@ ome for music from youths , portable devices and auto @-@ stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of file size , select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( english : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only be the programmer know who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually generated monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . if you want to know more about it , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) are stored on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real to it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords . &quot;
&quot; you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable l@@ ame package can be found with a search engine , for example . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg by trying to copy something into it ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , the effective device name can also be specified . &quot;
&quot; the map @-@ map General Settings . here , there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; record found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB large , think twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , you need to select the first one . the mode is set up on the following card map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put it all the way it is shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls are logging the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps there is more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be enough .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the CD ; check it out at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of concur@@ rent wa@@ v files : with a dual core or qu@@ ad or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section it describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will set up and set MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is built up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of the fre@@ ed@@ b is described , must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than retrieve them from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done , the CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , consult the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you did not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but retrieve the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Lat@@ est Tit@@ le &apos; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for individual commentary per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the CD @-@ ROM . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the parts list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected so are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the button selection to start reading the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the jobs and track what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; click on tab assignments to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read out to the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a enco@@ der you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully deco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment # 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of concur@@ rent processes to read and code . the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after encoding the last piece , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is addressed to persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs has many different options . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various box maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e how it will continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it all about ? if you read this , you probably have already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered to be the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is , at least , after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely , if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can drag to &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to draw .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; end while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth using the regulator . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a pressure on the button Pause , or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use song event and others both . some pieces do not have any lyrics at all : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically determine which one song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text in the Settings menu . however , you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summari@@ ze . these are sequ@@ enced in series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize ... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original one . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to no other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to add a song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when adding Automati@@ cally to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu sequences of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the Kara@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the next song button , the next song from the menu item or press the button Ar@@ row right . &quot;
&quot; to return a song vice versa , select the Pre@@ vious piece , select Pre@@ vious pieces from the menu item or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always makes a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary re@@ aliz@@ ations for the play of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except for the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how General MIDI Pat@@ ches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument requires to play with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ fle bul@@ let ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each sound represents a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple keys for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the supplied key maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply change it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on that channel . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; wander around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( to now ) two different views to display the played sounds .
&quot; the speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable setting automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard speed , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening Files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ Sch@@ mid , B@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting automatic addition to the collection and open A@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue to program . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment , I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m studying programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving phrases . &quot;

and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development , search for information and view images . &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you have to compile it with MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it will run as if you had a sound card except that you cannot hear music of course . &quot;

&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy student . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and long @-@ term play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if you want to change the files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / directory . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select Play@@ list from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is abandoned or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to enable a different animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / DATA@@ form@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / .x@@ ml / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start @-@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the view of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; meet &quot; / var ; / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@
&quot; there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here , the path can be set by the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file , just like setting the back@@ end using mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash is played using the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; you can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments defined by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , it must be done by modi@@ fying the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Players ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device must be used in the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player dialog can be found in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found out ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it . &quot;
&quot; since V@@ DR support from KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; at the time of creating this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ ore , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ sc@@ anners , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there any clu@@ e how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as root user after the device is inserted . it is absolutely necessary to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why does each time my CPU have to be tested for its performance ?

quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , journal &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ tra@@ che@@ t &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined . &quot;

new users don &apos;t have to worry . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le , it automatically creates a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be configured in the box menu ( e.g. \ \ end { Command } ) . this function can be configured in the box settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( the most common and sub@@ paragraph is the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files , the back @-@ up search can be very helpful . once a DVI , file &#91; source D e V ice I n@@ gum@@ File &#93; &#93; has been created , start &amp; box ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text . &quot;
&quot; a DVI , file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is , in addition to PDF , the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are connected with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding position in the DVI . viewer is spec@@ kl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings . &quot;
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI , file is based on &quot; &quot; ed@@ dies &quot; &quot; and over @-@ wei@@ ghted , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for spe@@ edy integration of joint elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Select panel is available for items such as tags , notes , notes or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a description for a section , a picture or a different element . &quot;
&quot; reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection box , possible ) . &quot;
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . the font sizes for the main text , the feet notes etc. can be set . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ osk , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document may be written from the bottom up with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically execute the storage .
&quot; if you fail to compile the document , you should search for errors in the logging . if you use a quick construction , you should start automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . &quot;
the changes are carried only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( count ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to improve the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat printing , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ string etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be cur@@ sively shown with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E may return to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI , file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ mend ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers and Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI file into other formats . once the DVI , file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been created , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preference search allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI . file .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , just setup Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Building tools must be selected . &quot;
&quot; in order to process the preference search , the mouse @-@ po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click cli@@ cked on a preliminary search . the jump to the corresponding position in DVI . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI . document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and spec@@ kl@@ ed to the corresponding line . for this you need to set up &amp; box ; in &amp; Ok@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( Setup ... Editor )
&quot; should an error occur , an error can occur . if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file contains the source code source code . in the editor you can then use the Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and fixes La@@ Te@@ X errors for sy@@ ring@@ es between the errors . to view the faulty line , click on the error in the Log@@ ging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the faulty line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the button in the tool@@ bar is cli@@ cked , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document may either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used for quick creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must open or create a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a file new , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or sign @-@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... settings can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ents &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be taken : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files . if you want a simple way to create a template , you should search for a template on the Internet and use the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; kate ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the ability to read and publish many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to learn more , and to learn its options , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the Men@@ e@@ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an explanation of almost all commands which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use and its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with a tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that by clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip will only be \ \ par .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with a modified Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight all kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted with a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional jumping tok@@ ens . this is an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries Edit boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . in doing so , this jump mark will also be highlighted , so that at the first entry of a sign it is automatically deleted . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the key aspects of using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; Even though &amp; kate ; already offers excellent options , have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code ; special commands for selection . &quot;
&quot; contains a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , this does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command is also available as &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back @-@ down rule ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to Edit Sel@@ ection Properties .
&quot; it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit Environment for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is present before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , you will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the e@@ ject vision can be lost quickly . this command then closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from the editing environment .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly open bracket .
this command will skip to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor appears before or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the group jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted , welded group par@@ enth@@ eses it is possible to quickly get lost . this command includes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy @-@ to @-@ use characters are used as trades . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation , the sign &quot; &quot; used &quot; &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and includes two complete in@@ feed characters for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double inser@@ tion sign can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used for foreign languages ( e.g. n@@ au@@ di or French ) and there@@ with German or French request characters . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when you click Shift , En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is in a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table setting , t &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box .
&quot; some users want to arrange columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to create this . while pressing Shift , Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already offers good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Ki@@ le ... All these modes can be set . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } will be added &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , as a result , the complete list of characters is lost . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed from selection of a command . alternatively , they can be inserted from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jumping tok@@ ens can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing jump brands N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ste jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Real @-@ time settings can be made to these lists . it can be selected different W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ bu@@ cher in general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for the destruction of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the destruction of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete status or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this has been completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once you know that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Real @-@ time settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ list of the complete destruction mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of crashes , which can be replaced instantly by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Lo@@ cking ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be set up . as an example of a query list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , where for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word will be replaced by the menu editor or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space key , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large tre@@ adm@@ ills are not helpful for auto @-@ destruction . however , it has been established that many people are written more than once in a document . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu option Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be disman@@ tled . here , too , the threshold value for the display of the completion can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the complete conversion files can be installed in the folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue graphics capture the format of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be followed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is named , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can then be converted to a PDF file using ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are compiled in groups in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating and Cre@@ ating View . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file by Alt ; 4 , and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
&quot; a new project is being asked about the project New Project .... By this , the following information is requested for the project : &quot;
&quot; when running the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet fully developed , and can still be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fully developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users .
&quot; &amp; tex@@ til ; and &amp; tex@@ til ; are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the major advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures can be edited in the graphical user interface from &amp; k@@ sig . using the command @-@ line interface you can create random signatures or day @-@ signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random signatures , any signature will be from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day @-@ to @-@ day signatures , the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an &quot; &quot; blank signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always sufficient signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove in the File File or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button at the bottom of the button , and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; in order to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot;

&quot; all found templates are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T are valid . therefore , multiple templates can be present with the same matches and mode details . &quot;
clicking a template in the shown list moves the text cur@@ sor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code in which a global and a local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary of the information in the dialog below . if a variable is a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a variable template in the list , the text cur@@ sor is placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use Kom@@ odo as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as support . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in a war@@ y working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I said , anyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete the file with current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Review option . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection is specified for both the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for Relax@@ NG verification . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , should already be selected , let the current file be selected . if not , remove the file selection and select the file to be processed by using the other file . &quot;
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is normally stored in its home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; have landed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus themselves ; they may benefit immediately from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the plug in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin editing plug @-@ ins in the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on one project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears to be bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on notes .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much somebody is working on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Pre@@ ferences dialog can create , edit and delete events . &quot;
an email is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see if such guides are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
&quot; to enter ann@@ ot@@ ation is simple . it can either be the note @-@ entry from the Editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by note text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the first name of the team member , role plays a role in the project , as follows in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; tags : large / S@@ ump@@ y of tags : cap@@ itali@@ zation of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Small Description of attributes : large / small @-@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional Tags : when checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not automatically close optional tags : as for all other tags , except for easy tags . &quot;
&quot; update the start and finish day automatically : if enabled , the closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of accent marks : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding code during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . restoring standard settings can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
&quot; standard drawing : the coding of newly created or otherwise open files ( where coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting can be stopped by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not detected . however , this setting can be stopped by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis , so that during the next start of the program the document from this backup can be restored . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the default window settings back to default on the next start is useful if the user interface has come through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dropping views . it is equivalent to the --@@ reset @-@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves to control the possibility of issuing warnings by hooks of non @-@ requ@@ esting information .
&quot; the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Stru@@ cture Tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause is something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins can be managed here . plu@@ gins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re @-@ used by any part capable application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load component in &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading when this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the plugin is correct . select to save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should later be installed . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ designed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only one plugin is available that adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add .
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger Plugin selection panel , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action triggers the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger needs . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ong session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug application . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script , without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible , in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next , as if there is not the current one . &quot;
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain two file types , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders are handy , symbolic links of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on converting . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property dialog that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus for the day . the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of a writing error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing as folders . they only contain the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and decl@@ ines whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type above itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes inside this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the data source .
&quot; the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ en@@ ame % , which means the name of the current day . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with one &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows is to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
&quot; currently , this function is not yet available . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; void &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; void &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; / &gt; and lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DT@@ D @-@ editing DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for one from a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set up actions with Settings ... to be created . clicking on New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut , assigned to this action . by clicking the user @-@ defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but not limited ) can be started , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) to be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot;
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if von &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field entry can be determined , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed according to the input . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , written to the default output . it can be specified , which is set with the text written to the standard output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings action . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start is called , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered as loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this icon will insert a &amp; lt ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with Settings action ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags as there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to tool@@ bar or it should be shared by some separ@@ ators into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar setting dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . &quot;
perhaps the most recent extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; func@@ 1 = func@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html &gt; tag@@ 3@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder indicated ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files .
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is indicated . by checking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file link lines . &quot;
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or else . there is an email with an email , send a tool@@ bar with email , send tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . we recommend that our team members them as correct and useful for publishing . in order to make a contribution , we encourage the origin of resources , both for our team and for future users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key after its pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialogue New resource , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource . &quot;
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; but the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format could be needed . there is the easiest way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D File menu and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string , which is in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / W3@@ C / / W3@@ C / / W3@@ C / / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; adjusted . it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it stores all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; pattern up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ es the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the construction supervis@@ ors , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bars . please click in and for more information on these fields . &quot;
&quot; you can click the map icon with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all tab @-@ tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zer , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right sk@@ id in the editor area will lead to a further context menu related to the edited documentation content , such as editing / copying / past@@ ing , editing the tags under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , or opening the file if the string is a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , for example &amp; lt ; insert it in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the construction supervis@@ ors ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open it , and wander through . in the presentation with index riders are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by means of a right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the relevant users and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands is opened with respect to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation to find web technology for your development . you can create pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can edit , edit and view project specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two map leaders at the bottom of the window , where useful information can be reached : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . through self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ron Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , and the oldest entry will be taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converts specific characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; converts text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the Anker Day . &quot;
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
navigate directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script displays error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
turning off the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents are group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available means of transport depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
&quot; create a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by setting actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars will be saved by tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server where everyone else can access it . see in .
charge one &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or someone else did and convert to das &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refresh@@ ed from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules .
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed among the menu items mentioned above . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata will depend on the Po@@ sters ; version .
&quot; very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; inst@@ ant@@ aneous switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take some time or cause blur@@ red graphics . recommended is the card @-@ map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the surroundings of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ e.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . when a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . in case of ser@@ ver@@ al scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let it be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hook up . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this way the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button . in this case the error search is described .
&quot; high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be uploaded in the sub@@ window profile , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by tigh@@ tening its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre@@ determined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details . &quot;
by default we open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened .
&quot; to open another project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project opens and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before ex@@ iting if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files can be found . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the main memory and forgotten when it comes to program@@ mers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk storage option is not in question . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer log for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. , by simply changing the view , several files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar menu , accessible via Settings tool bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ able via the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be set up either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be executed or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will also be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings action ..
&quot; templates are essentially a document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions introduced at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are written in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful , if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure by Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ... &quot;
&quot; once that has happened , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template does not appear in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save Sel@@ ection as Local / Project Tem@@ plate . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged and dra@@ gging to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder is backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ define he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them to them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in sub@@ windows templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / templates / templates / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to set a folder &apos;s behavior in the template summary , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the contex@@ tual menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded once par@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would be explicitly activated in this path , unless otherwise explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; allows for general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , allowing for copy of content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have the context menu ( shown to press the right mouse button ) through a complete command file for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green icon displays the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . by pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key is enabled by the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , where the position in the document is retained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large margin for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools are to be selected , so editing un@@ seen tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this allows you to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows changing the content such as keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculiar . &quot;
&quot; tags will be done in the same way as the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other ambient anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analyzing style sheets . unlike other style sheets , search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , except &amp; k@@ de ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already present . &quot;

&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path specification . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded file name with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a vag@@ ue named my@@ ME or a given model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with any QNAP that contains the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a desired stop point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made a lot of changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see exactly what changed inside these lines . and there was no evidence in the places where the ind@@ entation might have changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ability and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from each other in a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor under the differences windows makes it possible to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; also helps you adjust and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; in the folder merging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; shows exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but lie in different folders then you can ease the typing by writing only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ nu@@ 3 folder 2 k@@ nu@@ 3 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ nu@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ nu@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; open dialog allows you to manually tap file names , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog shows your selection and shows it again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files is performed . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , then merge or merge folders . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A to the other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not essential to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving . &quot;
the setup button will open a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge operation .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparative window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would first need to create two corresponding files , copy them into &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; simply copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging of text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the pre @-@ set color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the Pre@@ processor and in rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are checked , the line of broken lines is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ar &#93; when editing the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , no more line is left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting sources ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , right , high , down , page on , right , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries syn@@ cs the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Con@@ version and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture A@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflic@@ ted conflict . therefore , between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . there is also the option to copy selection automatically . if this is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and eliminates the manual copy . be careful with this option , as you may accidentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are using a new@@ line \ \ r \ \ r \ r \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not use the line end of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; also not use binary files . &quot;
the options and list of the recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to select , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab button . otherwise , a tab is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press enter or return , the previous line will be used automatically for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , any selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . then manually copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 attempts ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back@@ plate &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated notes ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping to the next un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . for details , see documentation about the directory comparison and merge tracking . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to exit &amp; re@@ boot , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
the code for encoding appears to be a short notice of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be configured with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
&quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just skip the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison windows side by side or overl@@ apping each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . you can use this function e.g. for cutting off bot@@ her@@ some parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is also specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at the end of the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line control to convert the input to capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This is an erg@@ ular expression that fits all characters in one line and in this context all characters are included in one line . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword sub@@ stitution ) .
&quot; while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ uses . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something other than per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Rest@@ ore / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;s How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders in a folder . &quot;
... make a suggestion for each object together ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without real@@ ising them
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see further details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that were compared until then are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will start and a comparison window will appear . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case the merge operation cannot be automatically selected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; however , with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . with folders , age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the colour scheme reflects the colors of a leaf which is green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B , and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; synchron@@ ize mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and when the option directories are active . then select &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; B by A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then check &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; during merging , one file is processed after the other . it displays status column when the merge succ@@ eeds , and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparative method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merged @-@ time actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , C is used as a target , and B and / or B are used as the target when synchron@@ izing A and / or B . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries that should be in the target folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / resume in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears to indicate the incorrect elements . you can select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Run@@ ning , Sim@@ ulating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , restart / continue directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then proceed &amp; k@@ wir@@ 3 ; resume your work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you avoid the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can select another action for the entry or resolve the problem otherwise before you proceed with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( at the current session ) do not merge again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Fol@@ der merge with these options :
&quot; only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree , several patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match that pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match that pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder specific folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that the link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be faster to compare the chan@@ gel@@ ing date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change , it is not a real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date is lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; enable synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging , the copy of the newer file will be suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file was not modified . ) This option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ orig@@ g extension , it will also be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge @-@ view lasts while merging single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the option list &amp; text window on the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing between the directory and text window . &quot;
&quot; you may also want to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu you also have a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly , without first having to start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify the files and folders located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archives with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; typically requires &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the program patch must exist to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are complications ) . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or have to walk this way .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably not the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . configure the configure script in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resource for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ nu@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , then these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not treated as identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the case for the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this has been too large until now . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; use many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
&quot; for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot;
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ nu@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position resp@@ . replaces the current marker .
&quot; only display differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ tops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as in several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working areas as well as the applications running in them . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager . if cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , you can move windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is displayed together with name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal and vertical row show , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear settings .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . but you can do this manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ .@@ If you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as a user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users , such as artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation is meant to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as the selection box below . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor , like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the setting of the mouse cur@@ sor . please note that the mouse cur@@ sor is currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Shift key , press the Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection box . &quot;
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it into other applications later ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update brings the required CPU time to 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and c@@ utt@@ ings &amp; etc ; . &quot;
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; co@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen@@ shot . you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click brings pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires , however , a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by mouse click and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , because of pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clearer : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and displays a mouse click once you stop the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can execute the drag with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , this residence time must be ri@@ pped before the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool causes a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when the mouse button is switched on , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait until it releases the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this feature activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , one click with the right mouse button . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system there and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set to lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button Apply , the settings are reset to the status after the user &apos;s last press . &quot;
&quot; the best way to do this is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first , with pre @-@ settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later drag the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which areas a mou@@ sec@@ lick is without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the wheels that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you are running a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to select text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , whenever &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click away . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should already be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button briefly as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains short . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and inflic@@ ting pain for the num@@ b@@ ness of the mouse .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to start a certain time before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases that should be spoken again from a list with the conversation history . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that is later used for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often select text passages , without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can match the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory cache . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the Pre@@ ferences dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the word completion page as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , set the character encoding , with the text transmitted to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator as default . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , further settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications will be a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages book menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the memory cache . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field closing of the processor for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages book should be saved automatically when closing the processor window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text passages book will not be saved . select Before saving , &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word completion page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word completion . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them into a file . &quot;
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are compiled and how these dic@@ tion@@ aries are to be wei@@ ghted .
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main section of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to delete actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either click on the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected portions of the course storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the course storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the course memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with references about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a postpon@@ able bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the left hand side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably didn &apos;t enter the command for the speech output correctly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page , and enter the voice output command on the speech synthes@@ izer . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the Festival is a speech synthes@@ izer at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ vis are supported . the license allows the Festival to be used free of charge and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the speech output is then possible with one of the following three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
&quot; / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v , r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v &quot;
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option must be switched on as default input .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to set your point count as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth &apos;s settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can send text by the computer . a list of already written records will be saved , which the user can spend time and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not containing a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
&quot; for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either the URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; to voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
read texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
&quot; speech output takes place via the speech @-@ dis@@ cur@@ ator program , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; so on . &quot;
allows to generate language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) through the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and configuration of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for text editor &amp; kate , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ directory . &quot;
&quot; before you can use cookies , you must install speech @-@ dis@@ cur@@ ators and set them correctly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have installed at least one speaker , the card card General will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before using &amp; t@@ ts ; otherwise , the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
several speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ool for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the tab card Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map sheet is displayed . this will also automatically appear when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all speakers already established appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the actors in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a type of voice here , three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls vote are available . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always use . go back to the map General and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . click on the map to create and manage text jobs .
&quot; if you have installed at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language output system . click the General tab to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this startup is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD will stop and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr ends , &amp; kt@@ ts is finished , continue , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the control bar when reading , it disappears once the reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start , cancel , stop and record text jobs . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the tab General and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read and select the text editor in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text from a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are read as well . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read and select the text editor in the main menu . then , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when an IR@@ C channel detects a message in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . &quot;
&quot; the file is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by email , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the program speech @-@ dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable speech and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; news is the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can read a long text on a web page , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text jobs . every order you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text jobs . text orders are intended for output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads them , this output is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text jobs , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
notes replacing symbols replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is delivered with pre@@ defined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Tran@@ sm@@ itter use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format .
&quot; with speakers selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send to a speaker , for example , if you have set a female voice on the tab speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; message will be sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filters occurs in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it must only be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replace . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is only applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be entered . &quot;
&quot; the filter replacement filter is applied to the text only if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ ary Fil@@ ters apply if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in terms of words , the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( space characters ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you do not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package c@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions , but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the Spre@@ ader selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the tab speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker will be selected based on the speaker features which the program provides , which sends the text to the speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which meets the requested needs . click the button on the right to show the dialogue box selection . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save or load your ch@@ anting settings , or delete all settings . &quot;
the filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ary Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD through &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that you can use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , DE , DE , etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two and console ; -@@ windows . first start t@@ d@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the so @-@ called speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ formed filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found above the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , you may be able to fix them by using a drawing release filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you will find in the corresponding documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ void with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can also find the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . also see the kt@@ ts website , according to information not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is , however , not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; get from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ void or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use your speech synthes@@ izer , check first whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ dis@@ cur@@ ators is possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can go back to phrases or paragra@@ phs , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you can see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add to Add an Spe@@ aker on the map , and in order to insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the tab speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . for details on the modules you will find below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will be made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls , you adjust the volume , speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display them gray , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with bigger memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed frac@@ ts@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders placed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed phrase . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or go back in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text jobs are listed and managed here . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or missing without support for the corresponding audio module ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
adjust the speech speed here . 50 . % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented the program must be installed so@@ x .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to figure out which device works with you . in case of doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card card you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; handles four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . after reading the output of the screen reader , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . warning noti@@ fies the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you want to read a long text on a web page , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , greet someone who enters the room straight . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is queu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a regular text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and screen repe@@ ats , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to let K@@ not@@ fy messages read , run t@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the tab card noti@@ fications appears . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; messages . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications on which a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list are ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected the user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which will appear in the list on the list box speaker as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose you can set the notification messages as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save settings for noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events will be merged with events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all messages will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voices , speech velocity , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;

&quot; you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sets . this enables &amp; t@@ ts ; faster with reading , since only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , even if the speech synthes@@ izer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; you can change its settings or add other set @-@ up filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn is to set up the selection of speakers by selecting . switch off the speakers selection and select text to read . if you select the speakers selection , change some properties and check how the choice of speaker is changed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; if the speech synthes@@ izer fails to support this function , you can either stop or cancel orders on the card card . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set @-@ off detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation , and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator symbols are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter retains the character set . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen repe@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal sentence detection filter from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application on the box &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection &quot; &quot; tab . &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top of the card speakers ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; Ban . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the chosen speaker here . if this property does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings .
&quot; because the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is , if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; t@@ m@@ gr will crash immediately when it starts . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it has ended . you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; in your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA are occurring that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find information for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / folder / folders / voices , add the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the card chart . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) either activate the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ml re@@ forming filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; for the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order to make the festival no mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags for converting SS@@ ml to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a character filter replacement filter , and now I can go back or back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the order is displayed , the order consists only of one set . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered by calling the command @-@ register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer . fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ st@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts during audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of speech speed but is otherwise not necessarily needed . Deb@@ ian users can so@@ x install with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
&quot; have &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( packed with tar pack@@ et archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;

cd kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; inst program make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first whether your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete speech output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generate language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the file festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes . it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install the Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , inser@@ ting the error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile a festival ) then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

&quot; on some systems , you must edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German festival . &quot;
&quot; this method uses special code to give the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; buy and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from &quot;
un@@ zip the program with tar to a matching folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ p speech synthes@@ izer which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ite is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions , so search for Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice synthes@@ izer which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o program transl@@ ates lyrics into di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file name . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; epo@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ p speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume at this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the Cart@@ ridge Spe@@ aker click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the Epo@@ s programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to programs on the card Spe@@ aker . enter in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ p speech synthes@@ izer which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speech speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; dict@@ ates ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use a command that writes the voice output in a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module Network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when selecting network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can &apos;t be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and is best . by checking the setting Non @-@ again , the definition can be permanently selected . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you get system management mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three Reiter : &quot;
the network interfaces will be used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces :
&quot; by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button , the settings displayed can be configured in the list and clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; by selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . turn on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specify the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical link to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sends this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be placed in priority by selecting an entry and refer@@ encing or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons descending or down@@ gra@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will appear . &quot;
&quot; the list of commonly known hosts describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of Nam@@ ely familiar hosts contains some entries that support and ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known host@@ name and click Add the Add button . if the familiar calcul@@ ator has multiple ali@@ ases names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
&quot; select an entry of a particular known host@@ name from the list , and select Edit .... The dialog of the acquaint@@ ance machine will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
installing the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; configur@@ able configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is attributable to . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point that addresses a valid IP address or , if available , can be used by D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a dedicated area dedicated to this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own hosts ) . the default route is required for IP for@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another state than expected can therefore occur .

to send e @-@ mails from the calling program to another than the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . go to Edit Cut . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edit Cop@@ y . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , right click on the variable and select Cop@@ y , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert an environment variable , first one must be cut out or copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , the option In@@ sert is available at all . select the variable folder . go to Edi@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to be processed . then go to Edit Chan@@ ges .... Altern@@ atively , you can click on the variable with the right mouse button on the variable , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then edit the dialog where you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to activate or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it , and set the state with the Edit Activ@@ ation menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , right click on the variable and select En@@ able . make sure the name and value of the variable are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; when all tasks and environment variables have been entered or altered , you need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do so , select the File menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only become active . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to fold out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is accessible only to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change user schedules . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on one tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ mit the band and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; do not recognize the preview on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index will be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change in the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
&quot; before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat , this must happen before you can format a tape before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , the band continues to format the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save Menu ...
&quot; once the backup is introduced , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box will appear for review . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the audit trail as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can re @-@ establish the restore , the files to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Menu ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box for recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; once you have confirmed the restore settings dialog , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the folder chosen .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located on the same file system are stored , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be registered separately under backup files . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then have been secured . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat . before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat to lock the cast in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a block of memory on the tape . the contents of the file consist as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape has been format@@ ted . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system .
&quot; and k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens up instead of its a small message window , you usually don &apos;t have access to system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or character string . in addition , the list of the log lines will be automatically changed so that only a log line will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the Process column , and in addition , you can enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as log @-@ lines of level indication . the colored representation of protocol rows can be turned off setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can display the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the Process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command like for example to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new incoming protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for controlling program starts when the system boots up in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it , without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort , r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , which has to do with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have mess@@ ed up the in@@ it@@ tab . if you have mess@@ ed it up , then you can fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called on with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument launch . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between the run@@ level or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved if you drag them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ table numbers of the entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : there is currently no way to recover entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab button to activate the various fields of work ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation before exec@@ uting . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preference is taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard strai@@ gh@@ ten , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you must edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without message if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment from &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user or group properties dialog . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled user preferences ( quota ) for users , a map map will be created , where you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the password management board appears , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; this map only appears if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable by the file quota , quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field File System , with limited space limitation . &quot;
&quot; the card group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group functions an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
