<seg id="14">"tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"& FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files, even then easily detected, can be recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command."</seg>

<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is present. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always maintained. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and these parameters need space which is no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how to split the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses by frame, so that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive branches."</seg>

<seg id="191">"if you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure to comply with the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection."</seg>
<seg id="192">"since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shocks which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows."</seg>

<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Adjustment and Contrast extending from the Correctional Automatic Correction menu automatically try to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the lamp values over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot would be as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the luminous factor in the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in one image or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a remodelling of all values in between. this is only visible when images are washed out and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is a little restricted as a color space with 8 bits per color is used. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. if you want to see the original white balance again, just click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the right top, a histogram is shown that dynamically change once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dimming down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance to the pre-settings list. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"save as and load the buttons as and load exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set, you can save it into a text file and load it again later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button reverts all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under Color sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for several photos simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will therefore always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation, that you can find under paints gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"editing & editing; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect that emerged when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently invert the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. finally, another upliftment generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition by & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia's strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers especially those whose barely landscapes agree.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repeat the thickness of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you are doing a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mold gradation and the simple chamma-thickness / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide. concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitised; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces fine-grained images especially in dark areas."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper look. in fact it sharpens no bit, it works rather psycho-audiovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to one color point. this, in turn, results in sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more later sharpening than normal cameras for home users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to focus with the menu entry Correct Schärding."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful, however, as the results do not seem to be very natural: sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correccia Visters and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Spam is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase of the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the blurring mask to strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined to be applied to an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharper, and therefore plastic flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). non-sharp masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicode; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected detour filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blurring mask. refocusing achieves usually better results than blurring. you can start it from the menu by focusing colors refocusing in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixels. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauss's fold is even heavily influenced by the pixels."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is palatable. in most cases, you should leave this value to zero to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the sharpness of the gauges. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cutting, colour and intensity corrections before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, Unsharp Maskering produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by harshing blurring a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"even under optimal conditions, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener Filters is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture must be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the method for correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the sharpness of the area that was darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour ink allows an appropriate colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Incubator was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values are chiefly smoothed and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subject to the direction dependency."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD rushing, a high value shakes wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best corrected at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooths [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above everyth. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stepwidth [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value little 1 to avoid sub-pixel-smoothing and never bigger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation use: the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the" "Save as" "and" "Load" "buttons make exactly this. correcting any image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="528">"correct image errors is relatively quick at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see there is a strange black artifact in the background that caused by a bad movie storage during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicode; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Interpane advanced settings can remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image. the area specified by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller faults."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or forging will occur again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the filter frequency response. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise spikes can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas which are typically more rustling.</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of the phase suppression. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter range responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system, and loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correccia Visters and experiment with the smoothing."</seg>

<seg id="918">"before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objective. in the following, each area is described more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="919">"first, enter the title of the flash and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings."</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created on the overview page."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer, even without description. for example, that all pictures are from a party."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically explained."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means those who have a look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images that have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so, he can browse your images with low resolution, resulting in a lower transfer time. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"for all your HTML files, select a base folder and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first you need to select the root folder where all your pictures are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically updated for the next time. you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to the viewer. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, correctly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"all three settings that have just been described have moved to base folders and URLs. in this folder, a subfolder will be created, the name you specify in the output folder."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you can, of course, create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time recording the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not even make this work one more time."</seg>
<seg id="932">With & k photoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it scans the images, which are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you have created while creating the HTML files will be only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Export..."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">"to copy manually to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">"with option Automatically Copy to the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you."</seg>
<seg id="940">".kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit maximum picture size. if you send images to your friends, you might want to send the images not in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the file import... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in the description."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category Persons of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is named with your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked what categories of imported file should be imported and what categories they correspond in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to see images of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">"modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself."</seg>
<seg id="959">"since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules have been tested with one another. therefore, you should first test new modules with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu."</seg>
<seg id="960">"the applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum."</seg>
<seg id="962">"simulating & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all the pictures you see at the moment."</seg>

<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to see each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture where the image has been recorded and so on. for example on all pictures Jesper is shown and all images recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">"all these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer."</seg>
<seg id="971">"you can see three lists with a text field by defining individuals, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, as you can always use them whenever you enter information about your pictures."</seg>
<seg id="972">"for example, if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 people, you can, therefore, move the names used up, to find and assign persons faster."</seg>

<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this feature see better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects to Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling involves the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is always separated and adaptively because the recess depth depends on the calculated colour values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, a grid of 4x4 increments will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are separately followed and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn on jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; diffuse light reflection calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of file size, select this setting."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (english: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like: '... -t {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; no more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only be the programmer know who checked the code.)"</seg>

<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually generated monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used. if you want to know more about it, search in the source code....

<seg id="1537">"to save the read wav files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are stored on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)." lame "must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real to it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI Patches can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument requires to play with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (rifle bullet), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each sound represents a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc.) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keys for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones on the percussions channel. see for example the supplied key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply change it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap must be defined with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on that channel."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; wander around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (to now) two different views to display the played sounds.</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"first, enable setting automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">"you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard speed, you can double-click on the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have on a & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a karaoke file) or tacked (if I want to play a karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;"</seg>

<seg id="2056">"after NeweXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most recent extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html... [Context] func1 = func2html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html &gt; tag3html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP documentation:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic syntax..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder indicated!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is indicated. by checking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file link lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / doc or $KDEDIR / share / doc or $KDEDIR / share / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or else. there is an email with an email, send a toolbar with email, send tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. we recommend that our team members them as correct and useful for publishing. in order to make a contribution, we encourage the origin of resources, both for our team and for future users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key after its passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the dialogue New resource, the input fields have to be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbars, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, check & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; but the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format could be needed. there is the easiest way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from the DTD File menu and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in order to understand this and full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; it stores all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; pattern up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emes the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor, where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP, a small green icon displays the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; Editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. by pressing F9, this mode is already active, the key is enabled by the active cursor from a window to the other, where the position in the document is retained."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is configurable via Settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large margin for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"assuming you want to change the title of the website, tools are to be selected, so editing unseen tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; this allows you to change the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows changing the content such as keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & knu3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made a lot of changes and at the same time changed the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see exactly what changed inside these lines. and there was no evidence in the places where the indentation might have changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & knu3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparability and merging of folders. this function turned & knu3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from each other in a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor under the differences windows makes it possible to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& knu3; also helps you adjust and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & knu3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& knu3; shows exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but lie in different folders then you can ease the typing by writing only the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & knu3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog, you don't have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">"you can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor, and let it fall over a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how much these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would first need to create two corresponding files, copy them into & knu3; simply copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at present, you can't remove anything from & knu3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dragging of text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color."</seg>

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2354">"while you are experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>

<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed, you can also use something other than perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Restore / SCHALTER's However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2511">"first, you should be aware of which areas a mouseclick is without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again."</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"the solution for this problem is that you are running a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another location."</seg>
<seg id="2519">"solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the headlines of windows."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system provides the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"and ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if you don't see it, and it opens up instead of its a small message window, you usually don't have access to system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or character string. in addition, the list of the log lines will be automatically changed so that only a log line will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the Process column, and in addition, you can enter the name of a process in the protocol file system log; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log-lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as log-lines of level indication. the colored representation of protocol rows can be turned off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can display the process identification (PID) in the Process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command like for example to start the samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new incoming protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is quickly becoming the standard for controlling program starts when the system boots up in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init, without reinstalling and re-formatting."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, rc.sysinit and the following other folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, which has to do with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have messed up the inittab. if you have messed it up, then you can fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called on with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument launch."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc;, network & etc;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between the runlevel or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position)."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved if you drag them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sortable numbers of the entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to recover entries thrown into the recycle bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab button to activate the various fields of work (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before executing."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preference is taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard straighten, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for running running under runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services in these distributions are started, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply exit without message if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that it can be added to this manual."</seg>
