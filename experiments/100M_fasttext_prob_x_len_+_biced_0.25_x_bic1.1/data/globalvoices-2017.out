although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; It was me , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I was living in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter of his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; he never thinks of the mountain , as you say so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and agreed in comments for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated candidate ever .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ots person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Programme , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also Tr@@ ump Welt@@ anschau@@ ung agreed not to the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at play . &quot;
&quot; d@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still adju@@ sts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lew@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me much during my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white people , gave the presi@@ dency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the tr@@ ump voters to be ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears concerning the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps . perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ its the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; white @-@ white pu@@ n in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means the big Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan joined the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now a drop of land , &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC . &quot;

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close relationship with ... &quot;
music that lives with waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs .
&quot; however , after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laughing and with shining eyes and play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all produced from the garbage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
at first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage . the children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; defines the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing .

&quot; this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practical solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
&quot; as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , the re @-@ publication takes place in conjunction with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before the other coast of Africa sought . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the East African countries were anger@@ ed and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind to their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u re@@ members , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; besides Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had then expelled the Premier from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and are mutually dependent where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with the information circul@@ ating between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbor inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also very atten@@ tively pursu@@ es the activities of ships when they move around the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . also , such suspi@@ cious travel routes can be discovered - such as indicating that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were traveling and possibly whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD from lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of fantasy names , fishing in protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You should not run my harbor &apos; . &quot;
&quot; yet another country could say &apos; Come to Me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front has func@@ tioned . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system linking different levels of information to one another . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is designed to help other ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Sea Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of which each single tracking ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships which used to be f@@ ished without a license earlier and hardly expected to have consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now posted a 33 % increase in fishing revenue since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets that were prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object each year . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; six countries have joined forces in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Safety is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under the wrong flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license and used tow@@ ing nets that are now forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London , where she writes about the topic of the environment , technique and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is spreading further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot; &quot;
the movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others , in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north @-@ located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current president , Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision in its latest article as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and profit rates belong to the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated to be 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to regain the country &apos;s institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups are united , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the elections in 2015 to the majority of representatives of the opposition . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the &quot; &quot; Un@@ conqu@@ ering of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also clas@@ hes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I &apos;m hungry ?

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell of confron@@ tations and reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment are pil@@ ing up . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own testimony . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ des state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic ren@@ ders the round that depic@@ ts the extent of repression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has oppressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an official approval procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
&quot; others see these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from its point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from spreading critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches tend to increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than working or going shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was first published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 , Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities committed in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the course of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba against his father . &quot;
the trial ended on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he retained the family secret for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

filing of records .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows what great power a parent has over his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; only insist that they will not kid@@ nap you one day , and I have to save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Workers &apos; Party . &quot;
&quot; therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the base of the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small box wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; over there , the prisoners are tortured . &quot;
&quot; I went in and saw a couch , where people were tortured . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
&quot; they seldom captiv@@ ated a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured him with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ dy .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell at once again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the deta@@ inees were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carrying blin@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with their faces - they were all tied at hands and feet .
&quot; close to the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
&quot; they were cast into a pit , and were killed by soldiers and buried . &quot;
I know this because my father spoke about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were called offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero picked up a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survi@@ vor of the civil war Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the ab@@ duc@@ tees arrived here . &quot;
&quot; when looking at the map , you see that they took approximately this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one has fought against an enemy that has been fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one ste@@ als into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and shou@@ ted : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you with your own hands . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this is how my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought home clothing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses go away ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
she was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
&quot; I repeatedly asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
one could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families to whom to pass their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , something always remains . &quot;
I have seen how you killed people !
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of showing my father was during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to witness for him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody .
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly disgu@@ sted and asked myself what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I posted the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own father .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to particle size in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were witnesses , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 alle@@ gations were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court sentenced life imprisonment and nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and taken to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be established there , which is now run by human rights organisations . &quot;

translation error makes elderly people in K@@ YO@@ TO a &quot; terrible drive &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO where you can pro@@ long your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a very mis@@ placed translation last month . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word of &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; on a sign , wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious rear thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic indicators in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
&quot; editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like K@@ YO@@ TO simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger told us how to ap@@ ologi@@ ze :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News spoke a bit more detailed about the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists , who are involved in accidents across the country , is a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors were caused by a total of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the above @-@ mentioned re@@ porter sent comments to the light which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to s@@ nat@@ ch against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on the translation error on Yahoo , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How faulty is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a genuine translation error .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and provide active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ finding , or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; however , some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , but from large corporations or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eed con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer available . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organised by opposition groups that opposed the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
the protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was sn@@ apped , and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened t@@ elec@@ oms with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers will respond accurately to requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by DNS , the server will respond correctly or refuse the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third channel , the transfer was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia reporting on the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Elec@@ toral , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
&quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ m@@ son for the family . in Paraguay , one design@@ ates the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls , who were affected by the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced them . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the cri@@ tique guarantees in general silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family that their daughter believes in believing that they will complete their training , improve their position in society , and can &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with her and justi@@ fies her exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it for many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , however , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent put@@ ts . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was the Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra opened with a stick on Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the girl &apos;s death .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest r@@ allies and demanded that there should be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ tique , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a landmark case - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is brought to justice . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ cket
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tes are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers now had to work all the time and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went back home and had time to study . &quot;
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; some evenings forced the master of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and read editorial papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o , &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; the master of the house had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they often allowed me to visit my family , because they felt that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had given her , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , totally clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; a thing about which is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;

society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the moder@@ ator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please log in .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland who wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
&quot; then , the author once again switched to the display : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I am looking for it to work with her . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ ck@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , who ens@@ la@@ ved the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors in Paraguay , and the indigenous population had to go to a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes social media to Egyptian users to register with the government

sixty Egyptian MPs have recently approved a bill to &quot; regulate the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to provide citizens with permission to issue social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of the adoption of the law , users must register themselves on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a cash penalty . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video , and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is also unclear how they should make up for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the Ministry of T@@ elecommunic@@ ations to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level all around Facebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but until now it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techni@@ ologist ( senior research scientist ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , it means they are set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a court process . &quot;
&quot; technically , this is not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and that no different nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and to protest &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish natur@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in war @-@ drawn Iraq

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the spirit of Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards stri@@ pping through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish eco @-@ system &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a loves to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and pic@@ torial programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wild animals in the region of Kurdist@@ an are set up . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , has produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a commun@@ e pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring cultures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; for this reason Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , already alone therefore 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after that to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the victims themselves .
&quot; the construction site in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i reported the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent constitutes the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , six years after the catastrophe , it is still hard to move into definitive replacement houses for evacu@@ ated by occup@@ ations of houses ( of the state of Cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people who lived in the shelter after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have heavily affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; &quot; nuclear zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma continues far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn a living . &quot;
is the indigenous population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed found that there was still no lack of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
how it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the status of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the evacu@@ ated people in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it appears at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global links are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we address issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widely used photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was hospit@@ alized this week in the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer had taken him to the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which rapidly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer , and several param@@ edi@@ cs will rush to him shortly thereafter . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was accused of de@@ crimin@@ alizing the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police hand@@ gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber stories and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the member of the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window in order to make a photo of their website illustr@@ atively .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the villages in Cuba , forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alisation &quot;
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Al@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on the Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory continued to lose its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ utes daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is rising every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation again after a long period of time because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has imp@@ acted already the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions , and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the community saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were obsol@@ ete and hardly competitive .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose for about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eption . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which differ only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the abandoned factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; he affir@@ med . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped build . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ tops has been wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the present persons when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted by grinding very high . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the elementary community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to massacre them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other factories . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without a prospect of the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma plant , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at 65 years , not because he lacks power , but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot;

&quot; the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop concludes that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the ancest@@ or of the Kit@@ til@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of the street in western Canada , where almost two dozen indigenous women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs in spite of the influence of globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youngsters were not always profi@@ cient in the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English that is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and also move forward to our youth &quot;
so they can do what they meant to the Creator .

&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; of &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; plastic models of the courts &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ er district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce those sculp@@ tural dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend turns them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gent@@ a . &quot;
now in special sales : new tel@@ eph@@ ones decorated with plastic dishes as shown at the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been converted into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , an Em@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing start into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers will allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laughing is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
some users had doubts on Twitter :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to pleasantly surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; you can look at further bizarre plastic dishes under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 5 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes actually are produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports in- and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed often appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) that tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people involved in the battle between the prosec@@ uting authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project in such a way :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go out and look for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on 13 October , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but she doesn &apos;t pay her because she wants a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and leadership of the international community . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t care about it or look at it as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal for my 10 year old c@@ ousin to think that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ fu@@ tility of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village will be justified by the fact that they were &quot; so@@ aking . &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district &quot; &quot; : how a family with threats was sack@@ ed . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain is never passing , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence drawn by violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how about growing up in a settlement at the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , fry potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he talks about the nine cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence , and he had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody plague of his father that was shot by armed men out of a driving car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the fight against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ des per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages , to which he links , contain pictures on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fake .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; wrong description &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; wrong context &quot; &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker lor@@ ry crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . in the process , 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years , and the roads in the region became a dangerous thread full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
tra@@ gically the tan@@ ker fell victim to the victim .
&quot; representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated for lack of recognition .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at it .
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been raised several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on , the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one left behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one of Human Rights Watch people . &quot;
&quot; many had been cut off , shot or burned . &quot;
only using satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be visu@@ alised .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ sely relate the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a Blitz@@ krieg , published by the United Nations describes those who could flee put@@ ts , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ ds appeared like the following , bringing together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab message , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that the President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to convert this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was finally accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , were wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein &apos;s statement , but had not associated with this the image from DR Congo . &quot;
the Worldwide Range of Fal@@ se Information
traces of these false link@@ ages range back to 2011 and 2012 and indeed come from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed grain of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have outlined examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which side they were published . by doing so , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been linked to one another ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) :

country examples of false post@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers , where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also have counter@@ fei@@ ting examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only names the mis@@ report , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article on explo@@ sions in northern Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the neighborhood is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , back then promoted by a post of US , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize winner . &quot;

&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
an association of students of theology ( Mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to the support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims over the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo has been shown as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ ri@@ gate the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government has made a right to judge what it &quot; deliberately created news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this correction , which has been published exclusively in English , includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page fal@@ sely alleged that the president of Myanmar has admitted Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 , that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , Catholic near An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo di@@ pped , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and spark@@ ed a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9@@ 300 times ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Indon@@ esian ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image from DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) also instruc@@ t Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and date / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )

&quot; there are two strong issues or frames ( fra@@ ming ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally participate in drinking water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers , taking the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( for example , this study which investigated how forci@@ ble media influence others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggest@@ ing something , which can actually be used in context or in completely impro@@ per fashion . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog un@@ covers the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world which are difficult or at all to translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ met@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s VAT @-@ lap , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Char@@ ge your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ q language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The ease or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after warming up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they def@@ rau@@ d other cultures , reveal other lines of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; or@@ ators of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ fall catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; due to heavy ra@@ inf@@ all the river Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ agi@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after a statement by the cat@@ astro@@ phy centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 126 people were killed and some hundred people were missing because of the floods and mu@@ ddy sw@@ amps . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been transported to 304 locations . &quot;
the ra@@ inf@@ all took place on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water bo@@ oths of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns save the Children after more rain@@ falls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are being made to transport emer@@ gen@@ cies to the residents of their flooded villages .
also different organizations and startups have agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 9@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app so that the disaster center will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; button allowing users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a S@@ OS button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people living in need of security and provide aid measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restoring norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we are making rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and men , some hold the iconic image of a woman with scar@@ f high , tied out of an American flag , others are sc@@ aling slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , right ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has developed in their imagination . &quot;
they dis@@ ab@@ dic@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , must be ab@@ duc@@ ted . &quot;
to be ab@@ duc@@ ted
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim minister and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Qur &apos;an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western imagination , the Rum@@ is religion was er@@ ased as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another exists in the Islamic images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting pic@@ torial language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to susp@@ end them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative will fail to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
&quot; it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , brought here with slave vessels . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has so deeply and fla@@ wed our collective imagination , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
in the news industry we are dealing with more than just stories that are based on facts .
or alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed mis@@ er@@ ably to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are representing the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ armed Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants originating from 77 countries .

&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs who all bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam has been manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who tears the head of a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Muslim when she could look at the 15 meters of concrete and air separating our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I kept her silent in my arms , and she whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim belief is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as they gain a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
&quot; it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an containing many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire &quot; which a company founded with the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colonial &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was lab@@ elled as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever before and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons which did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and carries the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call to prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means to communicate the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this duality . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regi@@ str@@ ars who started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just countries that bom@@ bard it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; that is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims .
it is the wars we lead and the bombs that we shed on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with respect to evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to Con@@ duct
we are deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the bad and dangerous expressions that we have in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .

&quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , we have to imagine a new future in which we have no president who bombar@@ ds chocolate cake while he has already broken lands and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity
&quot; story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , counting stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language from large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
&quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to the listening in order to appreciate , to feel , to make . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story stories tell their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and presentation make it possible for the audience to listen to it . &quot;
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso tale that is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ u@@ ar@@ ara asks : &quot; how is it to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siv@@ ity : &quot;
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of sovereign debt from the United States
&quot; on 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on 3 April 2017 . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts will be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , working conditions corresponding to the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find a drop in pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not an integrated sovereign territory in the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of the state &apos;s infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside are threatened without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; the demonstration called &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth &quot; . &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publisher of books produced by Book S@@ prints , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it reads : &quot;
this book would like to discuss how to build moti@@ ons for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with this .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who has been deta@@ ined in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme convic@@ tions ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra from his cell in A@@ dra as a &quot; top secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here mer@@ ges Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in prison . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually keeping them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ clamation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
&quot; it happens during every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind at the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the prison &apos;s crush
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; with passion I carry with me , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I &apos;ll leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all these moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year is passing , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under assault by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention by 2016 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
&quot; Mozambique : due to corruption , director after release after release again on previous post &quot;
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , in which a member of the government returned after half of his prison sentence to the state machine where corruption was perpet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants ( about 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose council ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to restore its old position as the company did not accomplish any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution supporting public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle . &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the off@@ ender .
&quot; the company , however , apparently remained silent and did not cause reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; re@@ fut@@ ed &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of which had been paid off . &quot;
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches ; he could advise and polish his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting to you !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn &apos;t have any moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that one is rewarded in such a way that the state has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ ale and serves the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served solely by the state himself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded so much . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , sharp @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the father@@ land for his ambition , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , an ambitious human being is criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and released .

&quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ ages .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Com@@ mons Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the web because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origins of the word are still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; of &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate language in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for use of the word , were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ishes all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting b@@ sen ) . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate language get a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all those who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply going to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored words to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
&quot; when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author expressed his opinions on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t include hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .

&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate language in social networks should also heat violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on the context rather than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the child &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the inf@@ ancy is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law which should ban this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ war@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group of representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere because that , at the age , did not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; each person under 18 years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office affir@@ med that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 young boys were married from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements committed to abol@@ ishing children &apos;s marriage laws , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without a doubt , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , to be dam@@ ned again about their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this virtually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but early in 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make it a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law announce .
one of the country sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ agra@@ m :
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and not a single one against it . &quot;
&quot; after he was decided in the Senate before , the draft could now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who holds a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot;
the law of marriage has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; fol@@ ow Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of the religious affili@@ ation .
&quot; the draft to am@@ end the contract was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed have voted for the law .
the child &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # custody account abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought for him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the secretary general of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to make his promise now . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj was going to act against the law , most social media users would wish that the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so general , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would say that the state , which protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposite to them , would be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia &apos;s content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist@@ ed the blocking .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sealed Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
while the platform continues to be locked there are now several M@@ irr@@ or@@ Pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform shut down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is , however , available in spite of legal restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we have everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website are concerned . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ ck@@ pe@@ .org , an aber@@ ration page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ Pages , if Wikipedia is blocked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;

you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if it is locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

back then he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ als to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation in his work helps him :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I was at home right now , when I suddenly called myself Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot;
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood afar off face to face to Tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger cannot be bot@@ her@@ ed by the sheep &apos;s opinion ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of Ot@@ ters in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband as a result of social pressure and fear of the consequences should they dis@@ regard the norm , this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a was condemned by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and rejected by her family and the village community after receiving a married relative with his name . &quot;
&quot; tradition their wives also do not mention their wives is also widespread among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , house@@ wives , a unique club , became the main topic of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the Camp@@ a@@ ign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera for seven years to expose practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and leads these clubs . &quot;
it reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who did not name her hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; not to express the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they have all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ eld and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not consider this , is viewed as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never had any thoughts about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name of her husband , wanted to try at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does it mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she smoked only in front of him , another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in intoxic@@ ation about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed at her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too .
&quot; he laugh@@ ed , and I stopped bearing him . &quot;
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip every day of the discussion . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
&quot; it feels great to be able to tell certain things , no matter how small they are . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a pants , they haven &apos;t dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the mer@@ its of its own choice of clothing , mor@@ als combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry it . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly in the five months since the first discussion club has changed :
so far we have only done small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling over more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a Day of Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
&quot; on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese t@@ witter trend , where many fans share memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese flip through . &quot;
it became clear to people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; says Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! &quot; today is the Beat@@ les Day of commem@@ oration in Japan . &quot; &quot; 50 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love The Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges may not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
&quot; and of course , some companies use the fan base as well as market@@ able , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at the mother of Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
this is how the day is going to run today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that men of terror could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of crew members for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for un@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they were allowed to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; according to the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia the BBC , the local super@@ sti@@ tion pointed out that the head of a man &apos;s head could contain gold . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on men &apos;s men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three shy men based on their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ack Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique said that the local police had already been following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the prosecution and murder of bald individuals for the acquisition and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably dev@@ out rituals , has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers Po@@ und S@@ nai@@ ve on Facebook , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , DAS S@@ ICH is ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to go to the streets as if they would not viol@@ ate sex against good grades , or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which people would not be ch@@ ased or bald for un@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter @-@ user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ faced : &quot;
the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of homeless people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deepest con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in Arabic blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who claimed to be inside the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s creativity as a pioneer of the Open Web movement proves to be an honour . &quot;
and we acknowledge the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , so the organization Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime , or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New responses of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man says he was &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
&quot; yet China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Rel@@ ated Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill @-@ ran@@ ged , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u , as she announced in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to abol@@ ish all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wanted him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he could help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US embassy request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany and Germany
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had a big concern whether the host could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u X@@ ia , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police have always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; in a statement on June 29 , China urged China &apos;s foreign ministry to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where it is needed . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan market in Taiwan
&quot; the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also urged China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved and encouraged as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question might seem sil@@ ly , since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they were compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , with most people making a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ rep@@ lies to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot;
he addressed appropriate questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference , so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have been able to win a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian angel ? &quot;
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they not defend their city but their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink human identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ aus , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , which lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question , which is most asked in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little difference between Canadi@@ ans and Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag well visible to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand , ... &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their bags to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country for ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you &apos;d conf@@ use me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , being labeled as &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be bo@@ ast@@ ful - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian double @-@ runner ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing on which one can stum@@ ble . &quot;
being harmless means being in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not worthy of attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major characteristic of the Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
&quot; the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends is missing . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band that is famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man , who tells of what prec@@ ep@@ ts he makes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not politically politically , the music video indirectly refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as regards the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta regime . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; change of settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are viewed as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and prosec@@ utes persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand fights against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ es@@ ties insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup in the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and waste avoid@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before placing them in an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Asia Minor .

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 , after barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , some 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elderly man .
he starts to talk and it is hard for him to finish it .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is un@@ equi@@ vocal . &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ ov@@ ka , which are still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to let us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district office supplies candles and bread to the villages for free . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart is forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells them that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; call T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ asha gets about $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once housed , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
she says that at first it was a very wor@@ rying situation when many people left the village after the war .
&quot; but over time , she lost her anxiety . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation turns to the end , a little boy runs over to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings . &quot;

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ar frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Afrika . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy medication which they cannot afford , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) poses with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to reach Boston to find her husband and her three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak of W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , he lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weakened , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; he rep@@ lies , smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they have departed to greet her , or to report her about the course of her journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian belief is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family joined migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single parent , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the ais@@ les , travelers calm@@ ly consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez feels happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she leaves a lot of photos in her album . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair care , she has made a girl , some photos of her grand@@ children and many more travelers , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she introduces her to me shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , by means of the fact that they are not ... &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an area of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a notification of cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is to block por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the min@@ ors &apos; filters will help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit tur@@ mo@@ il and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often prescri@@ be extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; published photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately , whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system , thus allowing un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s installation , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are turned into electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the town council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities , and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; an up @-@ to @-@ date Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also allu@@ ded to these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist video . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is missing . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissip@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from within and out of the outside . &quot;
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth moves on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough so that the city tore the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the districts demanded , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof several times .
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that fully met my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after giving it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry when we &apos;re not nearby . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes looked at me .
and you &apos;re really sorry about looking in my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was due to my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I said : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately . &quot;
&quot; just like his father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed set lies in my nose today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I wear with me . &quot;
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I remember all the details just before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one single prisoner , and I can sit down immediately without waiting for her permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried method of communication : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; first resp@@ ite . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars and li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s that lab@@ oured in the garden of my head .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound every day .
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which presented the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus , the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he will come to me . &quot;
&quot; he catches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that escap@@ es him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I got used to it not to reply .
I can &apos;t tell you exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , though I had nothing to earn this penalty . &quot;
to punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the kno@@ cks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cries . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not yet enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped shou@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no delight in it , which is why he picked up an electrically charged bar next . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition &quot;
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he loops his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village to Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ic@@ e@@ ye@@ asts ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and scrut@@ ini@@ zes its established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance to oppose U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b contem@@ plates his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian escaped of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think this is because I &apos;m a man , &quot; &quot; while he po@@ ds in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the s@@ war@@ ms speak tep@@ id coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just like drinking water during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior Jordan announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic actions front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled due to the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many people also claim that the band &apos;s commitment to matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which raises the old @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement might not be just plain rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear , cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional gender standards by ab@@ duc@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who mar@@ ched pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot;
in the past few years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ or mor@@ als &apos; - un@@ official .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is compo@@ unded that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a 1954 law on crime against crime , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; stay locked in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; &quot; and for their release often requires years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity , and is well known for not shy away from topics that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was in@@ tim@@ ated to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; Edward SA &apos;@@ ed &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is attacking the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were reviewed until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were torn away , twisted and cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not addressed to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ dy , a poet of the eighth century who still remember his homo@@ erotic poems today . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ dy , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service firmly established several former government entities and members of the teacher &apos;s association , stating that they had critical comments on social media comments related to corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; according to H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge - is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial nature . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and , consequently , resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the solid cars , drums and dancing mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years , in order to comp@@ el the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens enter the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these expensive hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts confront each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of youngsters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare

use with kind permission .
&quot; the following article is the revised version of the &quot; &quot; love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel expelled , to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ bar@@ ga no longer came out of the head from the Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os , and inspired them to the campaign called Cart@@ a p@@ or la Col@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the Guer@@ il@@ la@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; in front of Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years and were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians .
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would unite and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - messages of love to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more need@@ lessly . &quot;
he plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year .
&quot; the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the F@@ ARC members set themselves up as they had previously done to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive any orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an associate of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life has anyone written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him , and sat next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of war , tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; to kick off , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in hiding .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC have explained the history of the organization , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I often saw as a monster and even hated them were just people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
Colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and this is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles along our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of hazards , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community just like a ladies &apos; sword is not created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published that addressed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she ultimately moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you shame ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung . &quot;
OC Media : what kind of ambul@@ ances have you been put in - in which the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for having handled respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
&quot; they put absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was just bad talk , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she put a rope around her neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you &apos;re in . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this psychological barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look at how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do and those who stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who has imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told us that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still deta@@ ined in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend told me that there were not so many people .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to submit to Cad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there to be able to present them as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this only a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was even there when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why otherwise would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than it was now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to lead us to &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never even touched me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
one often says to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov came up with the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
yet - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize tea bags , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get out of the food . &quot;
I don &apos;t get a cent for that .
I have discovered these people myself when I tap into places of attri@@ tion .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
nature has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ani have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know many think about transi@@ tioning to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be precise , different attitude of life . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all for that - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 declined the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he felt ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , according to Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who would like to stay in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the internal burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority in August , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab - Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have led only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youth now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who were looking for a job , finished primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % had university degrees . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans newly emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their living outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speech of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists are al@@ armed before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is in@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , nor with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ bi and was originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even think well thought @-@ out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments in front of me , why I should be feminist and why we should all be feminine in general . &quot;
&quot; for example , despite the same education women still earn less money than men nowadays . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still going through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet : when I come to terms of skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , choose to mention many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; the fact that black girls and girls are referred to school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center is the white woman who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an un@@ men@@ ac@@ ed and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to promote their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; cl@@ or@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , that the black woman is . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm based on my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life does not pass , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;

&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on traced , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , which help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent to her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but you can &apos;t do more . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife reloc@@ ated her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report themselves to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; cont@@ ent@@ 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system , which is nothing sub@@ ju@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation be@@ atings and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to find out how many women are really mal@@ treated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are several reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women were talking about psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; 9 women who do not do this will come to any woman who will be ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this come to any woman who will not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists were counting at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , a woman dies in Paraguay ten days due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that doesn &apos;t under@@ mine anything
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she did . this should always repent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most prominent : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote contributions to Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had left Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier .
almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least partly to blame .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements in the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it mainly revol@@ ved around money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament that was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ e@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ pless ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees that Fem@@ ici@@ dal acts as an independent criminal offen@@ se and pun@@ ishes har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text was changed in some points to also win members for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ een that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which the victims of violence currently have to carry themselves , if they simply want to reimbur@@ se and receive a secure accommodation , to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get punished . &quot;
we must report such a long ad that mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed to the Senate in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
opinions on the changes take place apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , serving a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were arrested and tried in court but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he lam@@ ented the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to limit and in@@ timi@@ date human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that in the paper on 26 July 2016 , an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials have been accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a ruling in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page entitled : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was acting as editor @-@ in @-@ chief at Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , because of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the press of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 Korean ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; on 22 August 2016 , he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six month prison sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his one @-@ year sentence .
&quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to release Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to face attacks by the Japanese government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed an additional statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister once again presented himself against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated by press freedom .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Japanese authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , calls on the Japanese authorities to : &quot;
1 . release Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the paper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : there are two reasons why the global healthcare system lacks many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investment for investigating these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research undertaken by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic has shown grave implications for national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home in order to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; I also started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
what do you think are the major current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being makers themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is she sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : what is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is a need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa in comparison to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed of doing things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system reviews articles only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s contribution was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has bred let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of salads he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . on account of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate advocate of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton has always bred a salad , but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it is like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river , to which I have to p@@ addle . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of o@@ int@@ ment because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested to see if plants can be grown in space .

it is not by chance that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may commit themselves to free use of seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the open @-@ source movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says , taking on the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keeping their seeds freely available to others , as opposed to patented seed and plant traits . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material that is always available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ on features are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant breeders to be used or only difficult to use . &quot;
&quot; there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of perspective
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as changing conditions are much worse pre@@ dict@@ ably due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property uses other breeders as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees it differently : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to changing environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to ease their work .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is made impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; all in all , Mor@@ ton is bot@@ her@@ ed by the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form them and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are needed mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is just contrary . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they manage to survive most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
she also supports her to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell her own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country so that the O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open @-@ source seed systems for which the official launch will be expected next year . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report on the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network posted a statement on Facebook , in which it strongly critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true despite this attack and the contemp@@ t of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been so important as it is now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of articles and articles , which he writes for in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video , as the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; they managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , loading at the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to avoid cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courageous go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 hom@@ ep@@ ages from 24 May to 06 August 133 . these were technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also documented the blocking of providers by the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian people have no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the people argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army inv@@ ests in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;
&quot; photo by : Est@@ ado Mai@@ or ( C@@ ML ) via photos P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ as , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; day after day , newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rough dispens@@ ary with military weapons &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air port to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio in 2017 for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice has even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; on 16 August , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explains the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : it &apos;s not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neglect of the public sector . &quot;
the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mort@@ ars per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; Glob@@ o is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia has pointed out , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was one of these security policy measures to conquer a fav@@ ela by employing a massive police ban and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , however , this led to a decrease in violent deaths . for several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; lost spheres &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week now that the police cl@@ ot@@ he the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to revenge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime vis @-@ à @-@ vis loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel areas , controlled by rebel forces , have been besi@@ eg@@ ed outside of Damascus , causing inhabitants to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food like meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do can be used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of this writing , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , the 4th of September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and to help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October .
&quot; bran@@ dies were also recorded in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European For@@ estry Monitoring System , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the unfor@@ es@@ eeable tragedy
the objective of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to reduce the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal told the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fires .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the draft of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; continues Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from easily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread on fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems also include that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants sought information , or attempted to contact their relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ go@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : thereby , the site had more than half a million acc@@ esses . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t say so , she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
once more he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar that were heavier than himself in order to earn his living .
&quot; at that time , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran have been characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af ran his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church , which distributed food to needy people twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high availability quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can still be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ af too .
but his un@@ brid@@ led way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of the companies operated by Afgh@@ ans have emerged , among them tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality trade and retail , and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; citizen report : Egypt &apos;s law dra@@ fts enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

the Egyptian parliament scrut@@ ini@@ zes a bill which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of the authority &apos;s submission on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who fails to take this step may be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or the payment of a penalty .
&quot; the law , promoted by 60 Members of Parliament , is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal introducing tough@@ er pen@@ alties for insul@@ ting the president or senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , however , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts from Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway . &quot;
&quot; a prominent example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed the violence against demonstr@@ ators who fought against the military coup , which led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed , according to human rights groups , to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do exposure of among others weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a G@@ iz@@ a Criminal Court acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to document evi@@ den@@ ced documents
&quot; Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been largely interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officers of am@@ nesty if they return all un@@ law@@ fully received funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential plans to support the bill of legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to show their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
in the rules it is also stated that the registration with full real name will be required .
analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese network citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
will you see us in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , the chat failed to register with the state government as an &quot; organizer of information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ dor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court features blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administration refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was &quot; &quot; an information source working with groups to submit a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
UK can &apos;t stop fli@@ pping around
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the consultation is still underway until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
