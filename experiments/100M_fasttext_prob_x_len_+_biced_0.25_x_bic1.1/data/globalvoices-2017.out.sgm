<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous plot of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," It was me, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I was living in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter of his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never thinks of the mountain, as you say so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and agreed in comments for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated candidate ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigots person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Programme, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also Trump Weltanschauung agreed not to the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours watching the" Phoenix Suns "at play."</seg>
<seg id="25">"dumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still adjusts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Lewey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me much during my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump broke his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white people, gave the presidency to a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the trump voters to be racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears concerning the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commits the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(OB.): as much as" white against all other ethnicities "; white-white pun in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means the big Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan man whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the choice of Donald Trump, however, a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan joined the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now a drop of land," "said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close relationship with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shining eyes and play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all produced from the garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage. the children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra playing instruments of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" defines the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practical solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">"as part of an agreement with Global Voices, the re-publication takes place in conjunction with Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before the other coast of Africa sought."</seg>
<seg id="101">"according to this, the East African countries were angered and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind to their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "Benedict Kiilu remembers, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of looting the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"besides Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had then expelled the Premier from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and are mutually dependent where it comes to illegal fishing", "says Tony Long, leader of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information circulating between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a harbor inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also very attentively pursues the activities of ships when they move around the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious travel routes can be discovered - such as indicating that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were traveling and possibly whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD from lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasy names, fishing in protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You should not run my harbor'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"yet another country could say 'Come to Me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front has functioned."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support to FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system linking different levels of information to one another. FISH-i is designed to help other ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Sea Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of which each single tracking ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships which used to be fished without a license earlier and hardly expected to have consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now posted a 33% increase in fishing revenue since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets that were prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object each year." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"six countries have joined forces in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "Safety is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures even in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship under the wrong flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license and used towing nets that are now forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London, where she writes about the topic of the environment, technique and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the regression of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others, in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north-located federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>

<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the impeachment of the current president, Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision in its latest article as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and profit rates belong to the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated to be 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to regain the country's institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups are united, urged the demonstrators to join the elections in 2015 to the majority of representatives of the opposition."</seg>

<seg id="201">The trial ended on 24 August 2016 for crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I thought that was fine."</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>

<seg id="209">"during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison from 1976 to 1978."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">"the prisoners are tortured,"</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me for the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small box wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were parked and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">"over there, the prisoners are tortured."</seg>
<seg id="238">"I went in and saw a couch, where people were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom captivated a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured him with water and chased him a load of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty windy.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell at once again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the detainees were bound with handcuffs and were carrying blinders."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with their faces - they were all tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"close to the entrance, people crouched silently on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you look like, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why have you brought me here?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">"they were cast into a pit, and were killed by soldiers and buried."</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father spoke about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were called offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero picked up a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivor of the civil war Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in La Perla-Ribera Process, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">"the way you came in here is also the way, on which the abductees arrived here."</seg>
<seg id="263">"when looking at the map, you see that they took approximately this path and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'booty'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was at the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - I realized that booty is a bayonet or perhaps military signs that one has fought against an enemy that has been fought."</seg>

<seg id="273">"but if one steals into a house and steals the refrigerator, the record player, clothes, paintings, money... then this is not a booty but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could participate in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I said," "You who steal cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with rage, struck me and shouted:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you with your own hands."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">This is how my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo of that time, on which I wore a jacket and a turtleneck jumper made of wool. both had my dad from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he nevertheless brought home clothing."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay me on what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to say.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now that I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you executed people during the dictatorship. but why did the corpses go away?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">"I repeatedly asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">One could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families to whom to pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act you can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." you will never find anything, "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">"but, of course, something always remains."</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea of showing my father was during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities I had to witness for him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody.</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly disgusted and asked myself what the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings" "they allegedly defended were good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I saw how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he only replied," "Well then show me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">"in 2010, I posted the first ad."</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation error at a centre in KYOTO where you can prolong your driver's license.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving licence, witnessed a very misplaced translation last month."</seg>
<seg id="348">"the Japanese word of" "older motorists" "means" "older motorists" "on a sign, wrongly - but perhaps also with malicious rear thoughts & # 8212; as" "awful motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic indicators in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">"editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-Kyoto daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like KYOTO simply unacceptable," Holmes said. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the" dangerous drivers "(German:" awful drivers ") was later replaced by the more appropriate, though grammatically not quite correct name" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto Prefecture police apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told us how to apologize:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by insufficient correction (translation) on our part," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News spoke a bit more detailed about the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older motorists, who are involved in accidents across the country, is a cause of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of 19,460 cases of seniors were caused by a total of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"in the version of the article published on Yahoo, the above-mentioned reporter sent comments to the light which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to snatch against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on the translation error on Yahoo, among other things, received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "is this (" "terrible car driver" ") about not reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" "How faulty is the translation actually not at all, isn't it?"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and provide active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-finding, or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"however, some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, but from large corporations or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, we can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer available."</seg>
<seg id="394">"other online broadcasters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by opposition groups that opposed the government Nicolás Maduros."</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the link was snapped, and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="405">"earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers will respond accurately to requests of certain domains."</seg>
<seg id="406">"if a website is blocked by DNS, the server will respond correctly or refuse the request when calling such a website."</seg>
<seg id="407">"we confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet"</seg>

<seg id="420">"the one who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as a crimson for the family. in Paraguay, one designates the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another more rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, an education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita - especially young girls, who were affected by the Criadazgo practice - collected testimonies, researched and denounced them."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, as the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the critique guarantees in general silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family that their daughter believes in believing that they will complete their training, improve their position in society, and can" make something out of themselves, "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes up the girl with her and justifies her exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved."</seg>

<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret in paraguayischen households, however, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent putts."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was the Criadita in the household of the former military member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira opened with a stick on Marín until she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported on the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deep in the paraguayan society responsible for the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest rallies and demanded that there should be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complains. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her critique, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be a landmark case - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo is brought to justice."</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went back home and had time to study."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was done with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also did not get unlimited food." I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house than eating out of the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="500">"image of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs have recently approved a bill to "regulate the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is adopted by Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to provide citizens with permission to issue social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of the adoption of the law, users must register themselves on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a cash penalty."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video, and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. it is also unclear how they should make up for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in a position to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telecommunications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level all around Facebook. because of this, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to file information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But until now it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Techniologist (senior research scientist) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, it means they are set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"technically, this is not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" stands in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in which the control is maximized and that no different narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty to threaten the" public order "and to protest" protest. ""</seg>

<seg id="524">"this article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the spirit of Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards stripping through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish eco-system" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in sheer joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a biologist, Raza loves to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and pictorial programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a commune prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring cultures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"for this reason Fukushima Prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, already alone therefore 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after that to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the construction site in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi reported the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent constitutes the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, six years after the catastrophe, it is still hard to move into definitive replacement houses for evacuated by occupations of houses (of the state of Casetsu juutaku)."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people who lived in the shelter after the disaster were resettled into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have heavily affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land from Fukushima lie in the" "nuclear zone". ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima continues far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn a living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those surveyed found that there was still no lack of catastrophes."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the Fukushima evacuated."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also witness of the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated people from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the status of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuated people in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="617">"the member of the Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements."</seg>
<seg id="618">"this includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country."</seg>

<seg id="627">"the popular commune Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on the Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no significant sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after succumbing, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory continued to lose its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commutes daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>

<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation again after a long period of time because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembers exactly that Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry has impacted already the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions, and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were obsolete and hardly competitive.</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose for about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero. "</seg>

<seg id="654">"in the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education."</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>

<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come."</seg>
<seg id="661">"these were officially written documents, which differ only regarding the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date."</seg>
<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters became more and more frequent."</seg>
<seg id="664">"Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the abandoned factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters." the country had no money for the sugar cane factories, "he affirmed."</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations Youth use Hip-Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">"the youngsters of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this via hip-hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop concludes that the young participants discuss topics such as" cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the ancestor of the Kittilkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section of the street in western Canada, where almost two dozen indigenous women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs in spite of the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters were not always proficient in the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English that is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"thus, they can grow and also move forward to our youth"</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they meant to the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan it is possible to see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "plastic models of the courts" ") are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the tokier district Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce those sculptural dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend turns them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin genta."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new telephones decorated with plastic dishes as shown at the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been converted into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an Emen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing start into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers will allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or laughing is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">Some users had doubts on Twitter:</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example, to pleasantly surprise colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you can look at further bizarre plastic dishes under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 5," "" "of" "" "of" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "". ""</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry. for example, with shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in- and foreign media about the infamous" fight against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the missing and killed often appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with drug trafficking ") that tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people involved in the battle between the prosecuting authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video entitled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "(German:" "how afraid life changes" ") tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"one main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go out and look for graves, according to the people we loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">"on 13 October, he left the house."</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to my father's insurance, but she doesn't pay her because she wants a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the conflicts, fragility and leadership of the international community."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't care about it or look at it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal for my 10 year old cousin to think that he wants Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the infutility of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village will be justified by the fact that they were" soaking. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" "Four months of blackmail in the capital district" ": how a family with threats was sacked."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain is never passing, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because they don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I asked myself whether tears would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How about growing up in a settlement at the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, fry potatoes, make tortillas warm and make" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine cars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence, and he had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody plague of his father that was shot by armed men out of a driving car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence by organised crime and the fight against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizen's Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Mordes per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who we must not forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político created the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015 whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>
<seg id="816">When a picture is worth a thousand untrue words</seg>
<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNTION: this article and the pages, to which he links, contain pictures on which violence is represented. "</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">"but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" "wrong description" "or" "wrong context" "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tanker lorry crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. in the process, 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years, and the roads in the region became a dangerous thread full of potholes that were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically the tanker fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">"representatives of the authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated for lack of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "That is Nigeria". "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been raised several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters from Boko Haram attacked Baga and Doro Gowon, the remote Nigerian towns."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one left behind to count corpses," "said one of Human Rights Watch people."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been cut off, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite images the follow-up time could be visualised.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this misuse of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example falsely falsely relate the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to supply arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a Blitzkrieg, published by the United Nations describes those who could flee putts, rape and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported the violence against the Rohingya, pods appeared like the following, bringing together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi-Arab message, which in 2012 falsely claimed that the President Myanmar's Than Being has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to convert this information."</seg>

<seg id="862">"an inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images, which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo."</seg>
<seg id="863">"they come from a mixed grain of private sites, social media platforms and common and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese."</seg>
<seg id="864">"some have forwarded false reports, some have tried to expose the falsifications."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">"there are two strong issues or frames (framing), which pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion."</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally participate in drinking water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and does the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers, taking the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study which investigated how forcible media influence others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss regarding violent representations in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggesting something, which can actually be used in context or in completely improper fashion."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world which are difficult or at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremeta).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" "untranslatable" "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's VAT-lap, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Charge your parents in recognition of how they have been working for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsq language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi - The ease or laziness that you feel after warming up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they defraud other cultures, reveal other lines of thought and awaken our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these" irreplaceable "words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are."</seg>
<seg id="958">"orators of the" Treasure Languages, "which are highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here."</seg>

<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk is that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place on 3 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens front for neural examination of debt) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts will be held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed, working conditions corresponding to the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1185">"this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to the # FreeBassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, a publisher of books produced by Book Sprints, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Afterresearch)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it reads:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build motions for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own fates, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "Military Police Bassel" "had taken part in Adra from his cell in Adra as a" top secret "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by people who presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry, a designer, technologist, and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more proactive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merges Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project until now."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually keeping them in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proclamation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1231">"that I don't care about any of the dangers,"</seg>

<seg id="1240">And to cry and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">"on the first anniversary of Bassel's imprisonment, Ghazi wrote:"</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basle's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">"since the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian network for human rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under assault by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in detention by 2016."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">"today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time."</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: due to corruption, director after release after release again on previous post"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case, in which a member of the government returned after half of his prison sentence to the state machine where corruption was perpetrated."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose council ruled Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to restore its old position as the company did not accomplish any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not welcome the action."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública (CIP), a local institution supporting public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle."</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have a disciplinary procedure against the offender.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company, however, apparently remained silent and did not cause reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "refuted" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would have been a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of which had been paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches; he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting to you!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn't have any moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that one is rewarded in such a way that the state has so massively insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morale and serves the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served solely by the state himself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded so much."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel not only to be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, sharp-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously affirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of everything, including the fatherland for his ambition, his own individual interest, to sell. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"at the same time, an ambitious human being is criminal."</seg>

<seg id="1286">"Facebook blocks the racist word" "Kalar" "in Myanmar and censored many users"</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splitting bages.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Commons Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the web because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origins of the word are still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "of" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "Kalar" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for use of the word, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it extinguishes all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(splitting bsen)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who disseminate hate language get a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all those who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply going to use a new word or alternative spelling of censored words to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to extinguish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post" did not meet the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author expressed his opinions on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intent to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" chair "or" inheritance curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsily deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the grid."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't include hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1334">"the post says" If you are a doctor, do you then heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate language in social networks should also heat violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the rampant hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better on the context rather than on code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, brother Harrywarsad Maharaj, leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), a group of representatives of the various religious groups in the country, said that the state should not interfere because that, at the age, did not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as" "each person under 18 years". ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office affirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 young boys were married from 1997 to 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements committed to abolishing children's marriage laws, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. without a doubt, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should, to be damned again about their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this virtually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but early in 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make it a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law announce.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country senators gave a status update on Facebook which reposted Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and not a single one against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after he was decided in the Senate before, the draft could now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for over a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resisted the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-sealed Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"after China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked there are now several MirrorPages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform shut down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content is, however, available in spite of legal restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we have everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also indicated that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansickpe.org, an aberration page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that anyone can use to host similar MirrorPages, if Wikipedia is blocked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if it is locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed-out colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to take a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepals to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation in his work helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"I was at home right now, when I suddenly called myself Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he stood afar off face to face to Tigers:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the sheep's opinion!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of Otters in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband as a result of social pressure and fear of the consequences should they disregard the norm, this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State of Odisha was condemned by a pseudo-court and rejected by her family and the village community after receiving a married relative with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"tradition their wives also do not mention their wives is also widespread among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune district, Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, housewives, a unique club, became the main topic of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the Campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera for seven years to expose practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who did not name her husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to express the name of their husbands, is a custom that they have all dutifully upheld and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not consider this, is viewed as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never had any thoughts about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name of her husband, wanted to try at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does it mean that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands to Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women never allowed to speak the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she smoked only in front of him, another decided to release all the accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in intoxication about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"over the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared at her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed, and I stopped bearing him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip every day of the discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought of before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to tell certain things, no matter how small they are."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline Kurta, a wide shirt above a pants, they haven't dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the merits of its own choice of clothing, morals combined with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry it."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly in the five months since the first discussion club has changed:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling over more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they were allowed to use the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"according to the police spokesman of Zambézia the BBC, the local superstition pointed out that the head of a man's head could contain gold."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on men's men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>

<seg id="1600">"the prosecution and murder of bald individuals for the acquisition and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably devout rituals, has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth."</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized because of liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" Subversion "(state endangerment) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal matter" "and a spokesman says he was" "not required to discuss this issue with any other country."</seg>

<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question might seem silly, since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they were compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, with most people making a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-replies to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He addressed appropriate questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference, so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have been able to win a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said that Singapore was not a country," he obviously did not mean in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmugam" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian angel?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"when Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they not defend their city but their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahaus, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" "defense of the country" "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">"their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors about certain parts of the world exposed and another facet is to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, which lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">"the question, which is most asked in Japan, is:" are you Americans? "</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians may cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know each other, there is little difference between Canadians and Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians attach a Canadian flag well visible to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">"Americans, on the other hand,..."</seg>

<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, being labeled as" nice "is basically to be boastful - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure of Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has his own Canadian double-runner)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing on which one can stumble."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and not worthy of attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major characteristic of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with their neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" "The Dictator" "was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists told the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as regards the situation of the country under the Junta regime."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the Army absolute decision-making over important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the infamous program for the" change of settings "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are viewed as critics by the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017 and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillar frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Afrika."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy medication which they cannot afford, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbart) poses with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to reach Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak of Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, he lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weakened, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "he replies, smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they have departed to greet her, or to report her about the course of her journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian belief is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family joined migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single parent, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the aisles, travelers calmly consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez feels happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she leaves a lot of photos in her album."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair care, she has made a girl, some photos of her grandchildren and many more travelers, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she introduces her to me shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users, by means of the fact that they are not..."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan area of Urumqi received a notification of cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is to block pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors' filters will help the children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit turmoil and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often prescribe extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China "published photos from a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately, whether they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"a Jingwang product description also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system, thus allowing unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after Jingwang's installation, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang are turned into electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the town council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities, and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"an up-to-date Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also alluded to these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist video. "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is missing."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissipated and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable, both from within and out of the outside."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that gives honour to their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has knocked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but if reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence, even when the earth moves on the axis of the evil. it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to" learn my lesson, "as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough so that the city tore the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the districts demanded, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I didn't put high demands on a city that is stuffed into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by shouting "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof several times.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"a few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to come together."</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a magnificent picture that fully met my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment, you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after giving it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I am now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"Colonel Ghassan begins to say:" let me hear how you cry "Allahu Akbar," or you're only brave enough to cry when we're not nearby. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes looked at me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">And you're really sorry about looking in my eyes and not on the ground!</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was due to my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I said: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I have never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed set lies in my nose today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a mental torture I was subjected to months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in the first office, I leave everything I wear with me."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"then again through the courtyard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells."</seg>
<seg id="2035">I remember all the details just before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"unlike anything else, they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one single prisoner, and I can sit down immediately without waiting for her permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I resorted to an old-tried method of communication: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell comrade was a "first respite."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and is called" the doctor. ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no striking facial features can be seen, and doctors don't exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator assured me that they would release him if I remain.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars and liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have liked to have a scarecrow to drive all these crows that laboured in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from the distance, I still hear them screaming" Allahu Akbar. ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the screams sound every day.</seg>

<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black was the color of perdition until I saw the yellow light, which presented the horror in person: the Raad (e.g.:" thunder, "alluding to 13th prostitute of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus, the secret was revealed: to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from exposing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - so they played their denominational blackmail and betrayed the narrow field of view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house, which is not a country; it is a curse which they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the listening room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he will come to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he catches a" pleasant "conversation, despite the expressions that escapes him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join these diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to reply.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't tell you exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, though I had nothing to earn this penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2064">To punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the knocks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cries."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams were not yet enough for him, so they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables intertwined to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still in line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped shouting."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down and found no delight in it, which is why he picked up an electrically charged bar next."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body lying on the ground, was the perfect conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, which happened to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my father has to worry terribly."</seg>

<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think this is because I'm a man," "while he pods in water soldered Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the swarms speak tepid coffee and the squadrons of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just like drinking water during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordan announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic actions front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the MP and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said that the concert was" just "cancelled due to the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many people also claim that the band's commitment to matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which raises the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights "who continue to use" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not be just plain rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear, crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib moved to Leibe's traditional gender standards by abducting his vision of the fate of Arab women who marched premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years Jordan has increased the number of 'Honor morals' - unofficial.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is compounded that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a 1954 law on crime against crime, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "stay locked in prison indefinitely," "and for their release often requires years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity, and is well known for not shy away from topics that have long been taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intimated to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward SA'ed", "Hdaib is attacking the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, one verse often repeats:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can, in his words," get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were reviewed until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember that his comments were torn away, twisted and censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a machined version," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is campaigning openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals is not addressed to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nudy, a poet of the eighth century who still remember his homoerotic poems today."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nudy, who later was to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemian kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctifies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service firmly established several former government entities and members of the teacher's association, stating that they had critical comments on social media comments related to corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"according to Hdaib's opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge - is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is Hdaib - is made up of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial nature."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to rap and, consequently, resist."</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is presumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the solid cars, drums and dancing marched over more than a thousand years, in order to compel the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we could grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literal)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18 meter high carriage was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoke and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens enter the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these expensive hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts confront each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos about current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of youngsters have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their achievements:"</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla warfare</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the revised version of the" "love messages to guerilla fighters" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel expelled, to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párbarga no longer came out of the head from the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios, and inspired them to the campaign called Carta por la Colliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years and were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would unite and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people have already written letters - messages of love to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter, which should then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needlessly."</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and build up a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manzales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they had previously done to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive any orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an associate of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he answered," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has anyone written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." suddenly tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat next to the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of war, tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to kick off, students and some leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC have explained the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who had never heard so far and had no right to vote, and to realize that people I often saw as a monster and even hated them were just people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - even those killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbianists were prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and this is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles along our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of hazards, including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs on the LGBTQ community just like a ladies' sword is not created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya took over the international headlines several months ago, after reports were published that addressed the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in gun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their countrywoman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she ultimately moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here's a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you want to dishonour the family, you shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had everything to get along and started screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what kind of ambulances have you been put in - in which the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time in his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having handled respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they put absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she put a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you're in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this psychological barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look at how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do and those who stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for me, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told us that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend told me that there were not so many people.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to submit to Cadyrow's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there to be able to present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this only a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person was even there when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"up to now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than it was now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to lead us to" civilisation, "but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never even touched me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't worry about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov came up with the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Yet - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize tea bags, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get out of the food."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't get a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I tap into places of attrition.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy to you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestani have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians also have; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about transitioning to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be precise, different attitude of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all for that - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the past few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 declined the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he felt ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, according to Ahwazi's human rights groups who would like to stay in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the internal burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened within the Arab Ahwazi minority in August, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab - Bani Tamim - have hanged."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have led only to worsen the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who were looking for a job, finished primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% had university degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist with residence in London, said Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "led to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians newly emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and compel them to earn their living outside their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and thus be hired, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speech of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists are alarmed before the situation is explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is intreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, nor with the intersectionalism"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zurbi and was originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - respond with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even think well thought-out scientific and societal arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should all be feminine in general."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education women still earn less money than men nowadays."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still going through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet: when I come to terms of skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, choose to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"the fact that black girls and girls are referred to school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center is the white woman who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an unmenaced and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to promote their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"clora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, that the black woman is."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm based on my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life does not pass, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that has been particularly concerned with international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern through the region of Kurdistan in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "musa tells."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on traced, little respectable subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques, which help suppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent to her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but you can't do more."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena showed because of mistreatment, the acute display of Ada Báez did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife relocated her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report themselves to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content1 punches and statistics 2 invisible mistreatment and a legal system, which is nothing subjummt3 Paraguayan laws: good approach, poor implementation beatings and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to find out how many women are really maltreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research facility in Paraguay." there are several reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads went to the District Attorney Office for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the adverts, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women were talking about psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "9 women who do not do this will come to any woman who will be refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this come to any woman who will not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"until August 2016, journalists were counting at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, a woman dies in Paraguay ten days due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">A sign with the inscription: "without complicity no impunity. # Non-epless" photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that doesn't undermine anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want it, but then she did. this should always repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence on its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most prominent:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming her name, she wrote contributions to Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had left Carlos for so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least partly to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements in the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it mainly revolved around money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguayan laws: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament that was known under the hashtag # Poreas (# fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-epless) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees that Femicidal acts as an independent criminal offense and punishes harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislative text was changed in some points to also win members for the law, which feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions would be levelled, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill foreseen that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which the victims of violence currently have to carry themselves, if they simply want to reimburse and receive a secure accommodation, to the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of inter-human relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get punished."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must report such a long ad that mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed to the Senate in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes take place apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his agreement"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: there are two reasons why the global healthcare system lacks many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and missing investment for investigating these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research undertaken by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic has shown grave implications for national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home in order to support the sambian health system."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"I also started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">What do you think are the major current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being makers themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is she sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>

<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: what is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is a need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa in comparison to Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed of doing things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's contribution was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of salads he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue using them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. on account of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate advocate of a millennia-old tradition, Morton has always bred a salad, but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is like a boulder in a river, to which I have to paddle."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of ointment because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Römersalat of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested to see if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not by chance that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may commit themselves to free use of seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the open-source movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds, "he says, taking on the ever-increasing mergers in the global agricultural industry."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seeds freely available to others, as opposed to patented seed and plant traits."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material that is always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carton features are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to be used or only difficult to use."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as changing conditions are much worse predictably due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an email, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property uses other breeders as" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees it differently: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to changing environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to ease their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is made impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"all in all, Morton is bothered by the concept of patented plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in Oregon and Ossi Executive Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed mass herbicides, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just contrary. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, they manage to survive most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years," he says. "with a patent one is protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy for my opinion." worldwide resonance "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an" open-source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">She also supports her to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell her own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country so that the Ossi commitment cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the" Open Source "seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open-source seed systems for which the official launch will be expected next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report on the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "says Luby." "we are now trying to make people realize that there is more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"they managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, loading at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to avoid censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 homepages from 24 May to 06 August 133. these were technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also documented the blocking of providers by the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is exacerbated by the fact that censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian people have no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The people argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old killed in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro", "" "Thieves rough dispensary with military weapons", "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air port to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio in 2017 for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice has even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"on 16 August, the newspaper" Extra "published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the" This is not normal, "in which she announced to set up a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: it's not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of the public sector."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to Cecília," 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"when we look at the mortars per state, Rio is in place 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"Globo is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, as Cecília has pointed out, has been repeating the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, was one of these security policy measures to conquer a favela by employing a massive police ban and permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, however, this led to a decrease in violent deaths. for several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy "where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of" "collateral damage" "and" "lost spheres". ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week now that the police clothe the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho to revenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime vis-à-vis loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel areas, controlled by rebel forces, have been besieged outside of Damascus, causing inhabitants to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and checkpoints."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional food like meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more" awareness. ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform Cando can be used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of this writing, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, the 4th of September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with the" "production of fungal seeds from the regions" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"brandies were also recorded in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European Forestry Monitoring System, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"all of Portugal burns in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata, (@ a _ ataner) October 15th, 2017"</seg>

<seg id="2844">The unforeseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The objective of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was unable to reduce the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal told the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fires.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the streets were locked very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the draft of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," continues João Sorval in the same article of the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees from easily combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, continue to spread on fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems also include that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants sought information, or attempted to contact their relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogo.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: thereby, the site had more than half a million accesses."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups defeated by the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>
<seg id="2876">"even though his mother didn't say so, she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more."</seg>

<seg id="2884">"Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the party Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been assassinated by the Taliban, and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Once more he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar that were heavier than himself in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf ran his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"in the dangerous passage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago, Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church, which distributed food to needy people twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high availability quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000" special reception centres. "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can still be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who do not have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf too.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled way of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to unofficial estimates, around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of the companies operated by Afghans have emerged, among them tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"however, Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality trade and retail, and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end."</seg>

<seg id="2934">Anyone who fails to take this step may be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or the payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, promoted by 60 Members of Parliament, is currently in front of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>

<seg id="2938">"if the law is passed, this may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a prominent example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed the violence against demonstrators who fought against the military coup, which led to the impeachment of elected President Mohammed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in prison for a trial date."</seg>
