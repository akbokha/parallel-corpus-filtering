this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed over Iran blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ti@@ pping journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they disclose . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they reported for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of failing and ris@@ king risks , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone conversations secret , &quot;
&quot; as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit exchange , and even travel notes with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all the US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
today there are communication software that has not yet been written as Ris@@ en wrote his book and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls .
&quot; such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Secure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology calcul@@ ators , such as Edward Snow@@ den , have a way to bring about mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
or the nearest environmental officer who al@@ erts an alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that emp@@ ires and rich &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain this week . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers can go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent ller or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems weeping from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people see this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what it is . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; probably because , so far , there were no prominent Americans who came forward in these revelations , this scandal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , some US states require less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
&quot; it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off , particularly prone investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 bar firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that everyone except one lawyer made suggestions for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a scandal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules in order to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; that may sound very fri@@ vol@@ ous , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I can see that something has begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen proposals for greater transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the issue attracted political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU registers in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama @-@ Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally end the transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after finishing my design studies , I made a post@@ shop sales . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country , and then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake of asking him , &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to end kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot space !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; A@@ way , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at the tips of the door and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me , hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood , actually friends who were waiting for me to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate withdraw@@ s and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , with a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ go@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept from it .
&quot; so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people share public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
&quot; via the Internet , they can then invite wild strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; when you have a problem , you get into the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel - it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left @-@ hand sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet panic of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most of the guests feel that they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es Handy ? &quot;
could you please tell Twitter that he is can@@ oni@@ zed for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor presented himself with his name only once ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children were called ? &quot;
imagine you &apos;ve got 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
&quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed over their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we trust people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing will change . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stands out simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you talk too little , for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one says too much , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimum degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can we create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to submit these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , there was a need that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , business is very good . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to party parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked in the customer service department . all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts even if I only think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had ever been a problem . &quot;
for people trusted each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it properly . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; but now it &apos;s simply &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; to name , the thing is not just right . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for it . &quot;
&quot; what would be , however , if journeys were a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a quarter of a pub that you &apos;ve never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would create apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and seclu@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
&quot; students who were looking for a place to stay , &quot;
&quot; were taught to people whose children were educated , incub@@ ators were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay when checking back at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; in this way , the media are people who look like me . &quot;
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
people probably don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I made a decision to ou@@ st me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , facing the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should I do this ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday , that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray . &quot;
&quot; and again warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or of people who were considered Muslims , dra@@ gged into the open , and struck them . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have gotten the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces available , but not to stop terror . &quot;
&quot; regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not ra@@ dic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when first the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mist@@ ress may think that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a beli@@ ever . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would fit into their imag@@ inations , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but if one th@@ rows a gaze upon them , it does not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which makes them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m made the connection with God and their church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her of anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she cau@@ tioned to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we fear - at least three things happen .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian governmental system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit messages that have been negative about Muslims , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can indeed be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
handling Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
&quot; when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man come out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he fired eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled my shoes off , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed themselves and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have met a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy mind factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m perfectly normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; when one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest study conducted by Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about getting a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air package has penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the public . some years ago , they started to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; as a result , flight devices can reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of space . &quot;
you can also build up self @-@ compens@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other starter sailors , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device does not matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract issues which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which join to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flying is working with only one .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ ings , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to make it fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right in the right place is low , so I show you a video filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in compl@@ ac@@ ency , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even like it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let us take a look at that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller will fall off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if also restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in space and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine , on the other hand , wants to be a flying shade of lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us is the wage in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very distant gal@@ axy cir@@ cl@@ ed each other faster , so they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghtly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; their energy , however , did not put them in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was em@@ itted into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; first , we arrange the events in time . &quot;
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , a number of zel@@ liges has been created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has produced quite a few things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly bold -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognised her as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o started a test run for some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ uted through the earth through the gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my father to death .
&quot; in essence , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their signals from observations like Lig@@ o . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often conduct a really alpine dance in courses on rel@@ ativity theory . &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; for example , on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ched by us at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length should be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucleus of a nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public they will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ns published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott willingly says , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; with sounds , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible , to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now talks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speaking . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been occupied for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just around : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate about as fast as the sticks of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circles around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
&quot; on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot;
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or fundamentally -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them all .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus , hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own reflection . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the League project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watched them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to take a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos &apos;s noise and circus . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I experim@@ ented with an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; , &quot; in which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , what I feared , was removing my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is known for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I sw@@ elled to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m the author . I think things look aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created TV . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a large scale . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , four episodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created and not just produced , so I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires all around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , therefore , I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you direct a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just going around the computer and f@@ anci@@ ers , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that a dream job is not about dreams . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened into my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a result of a high sound , it was running a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting , intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever . &quot;
many people assume that when I explain to them the hum@@ ming that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what it does . &quot;
&quot; but the hum@@ ming -- when I began with television production began when I began to work and work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can no longer strive for size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; Inde@@ ed , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da &apos;s land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum was heard . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the hum@@ ming I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid writer Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you already knew the hum@@ ming when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who then is you ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on her way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and bu@@ zz my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and her sisters come , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of time , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pens and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; releases . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens up and an energy boost enters .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the hum@@ ming , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titanium coating , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depend on the love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignored by the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
real sums are simple and original .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like playing , like working . &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be rather than home ? &quot;
&quot; well , yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we hur@@ ried around in the garden , in front and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my cell phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the universe of the universe fulfil@@ s me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
&quot; you can do it too ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
&quot; and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed . &quot;
but there are 15 minutes in it !
&quot; my children are my fe@@ el@@ essness , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
in order to &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I leave and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; stands short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the hum@@ ming , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sum of work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan playing the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the hum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me spreads . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I &apos;m the author . I think things look like I &apos;ll stir you to life .
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the best known ones , the &quot; &quot; Deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; an electro@@ de is im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from violent trem@@ bling and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at that time , I was the chief doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
often I cared for patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes part s@@ wollen brain mass must be removed . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to make cells grow from one tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to manage . &quot;
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly split and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are faced with a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we reim@@ proved them at the birth place of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t - auto transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ port these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we reim@@ ported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we followed an injury and re @-@ emp@@ ted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they did that very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to humans , they spontaneously re@@ juven@@ ated to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree just like the monkey .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; see now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimulation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us as well .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant it with humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Luigi Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy disappears with us , in Europe . &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
&quot; at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my angry friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ um@@ bs to a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are bri@@ gh@@ tened , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the twin peak parad@@ ox .
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash which is part of the high net worth of savers and corporations that are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and generate income , with which it could produce the debt settlement and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ated in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and to increase the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that fear@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would not invest in which they do not invest . &quot;
un@@ intentionally causing the circumstances leading to the body to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ der with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many , of course -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the crucial factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the toil@@ ing poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political participation with the same voting rights in questions of the state of the state . &quot;
&quot; true , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long -- &quot;
&quot; like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burnt out . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , while the economy gradually under@@ mined politics and dis@@ sol@@ ves it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because you can be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power because power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , who so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals of which she feeds , that she star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , with the economy which has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics itself , it har@@ ms itself by the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality increases , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the policies and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the toil@@ ing poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the toil@@ ing poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , wa@@ sting the waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that he has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which machines serve people and humans are stuck in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is working - is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all revenues come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work where the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it the cosmos , in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal , in which they prefer privileged individuals , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls for &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the west &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to submit to China now , to do what the West itself did in the 19th century itself smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and continual denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro@@ group , have continued to choose denial . &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
that is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes happen , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or a minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such ten@@ se situation , asser@@ ts that he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request to extend the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions which ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that for 5 years they had been conducting a disa@@ strous program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika of the len@@ ders , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not out@@ lived . &quot;
&quot; for if they do not survive , the liberated centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on a post @-@ modern 1930s , what it seems to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of you have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is the leading employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an i@@ gel @-@ hair@@ cut and is described on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the turn . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on average entertainment , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and introduces them online , where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon publishes articles for free , do you get too , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or look at once again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this one reads : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Repub@@ lican U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give to the shows their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow means that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optim@@ ises it through very powerful computers .
&quot; the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work this way , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are produced . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful nature of data analysis -- by analyzing Google &apos;s research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very clever people make use of many data uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you ever need to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a branch , you put the components together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this purpose , there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is important to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and reason , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . however , the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their choices , first as they comp@@ eted for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data starts to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will get it out later with a technical demo .
I have made some decisions in my life so far and I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight of the ball .
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it still pays to make decisions , to make decisions , to be an expert in what one does , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
