Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ na@@ vi showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ at@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but topical - but therefore very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; for towns and communities more detailed maps , so @-@ called urn sheets , were incorporated into the large overview map . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian Pres@@ sur@@ veying Authority between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops finally moved away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey of sur@@ veying . &quot;
the original document for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
&quot; compared to early / today , the state capital is most impressive . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered Fl@@ ur@@ tees from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ tak@@ er , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small par@@ c@@ els now occupy no more farmers there , but small farmers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the venue of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the document , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ den led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended up buying the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , there was first place , later expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was not sufficient any more - the reason for the construction of the C@@ rot@@ unda Club in Haar in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry centres , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
young people in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich meet at the premises of the former Au@@ er Institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was erected in an architectural basis on the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ ian Institution , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 56 the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the shopping street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change even in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs destroyed many of the holes in the city centre . &quot;
a great one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where the ground@@ breaking ceremony took place on 5 April 2017 for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights group releases travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur in the whole country and are noted here , &quot; &quot; states the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , making it harder for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that are dispro@@ portion@@ ate on minorities , led the group to issue the warning , &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard before .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel in the state during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said the Chapel . &quot;
people must be willing to take care allowance or let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws that bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further racial pro@@ stitution . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Members Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Stadt @-@ association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the right @-@ hand gra@@ vey@@ ard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted an insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housing the five apartments . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , according to Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V president of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep faces .
the green area ensures a lot of work and much has to be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not conduct bio@@ activity . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader &apos;s support . &quot;
&quot; at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could still be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their business , &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot;
&quot; due to the promotion , farmers often stand in criticism &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were enclosed in the electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ air area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and ma@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; here , the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state funding of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest intact .
the requirement is the presence of a subsi@@ dy set by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the area to be fenced must not be smu@@ g@@ gled ( slopes above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ men electric fence project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a short distance of 16 kilometres , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the maintenance area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the car@@ ef@@ ree throw of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but it resor@@ ted to its importance , and in particular the significance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the monument was completed , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller lies appropriately right , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your arms , your oppressed masses , who lon@@ gs to breathe freely , / the miserable wa@@ stes of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; waste &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot;
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict of the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , the people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody , but rather an early neo@@ conservative who brings the American flame to the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving on . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the viewpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful men after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch should not ligh@@ ten the road , but to ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black presents Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the power director of the UK &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Championship , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special has been developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m course , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle has been chosen by the team for team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; Black says . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total score for athletes at the World Championship was seven reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir runs along this road and last year posted five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that should be observed after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that she is &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of her fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but also in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ ds . &quot;
as far as my speech as captain is concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there , and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers proposed it all , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he le@@ aked at criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a reci@@ pro@@ cal reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement by the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a strong hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news report &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same topic , then they are regarded by some rather as a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; attacks would probably be called &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest or to silence the demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she joined a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
that shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck their leaders . &quot;
and even back then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trading and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance club
&quot; the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how it achieves its fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he stuck this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the promotion on his home ground . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Mr Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy as to how it has gone so far .
&quot; the trio in the field are the former masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ in . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Schot@@ ten in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
reduced lung cancer rate due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were over 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in Vill@@ inger Street is in full swing and &quot; &quot; lying reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; said the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction works , is a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s tru@@ ffle . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers before red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses had the right to drive through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Ko@@ est@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the quiet Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally places a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the carb@@ oni@@ zed bulb will be removed and swal@@ lowed with eager , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example washing clothes with mud @-@ like water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , working late can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was shot in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by public lifting in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car . &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs , which have been transformed into different yellow @-@ brown tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an ad@@ ored a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing out to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , dark shirt and bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua &apos;s wood resources are valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua people to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military retains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million from local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
&quot; the Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose , and are dealt with mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Committee of Human Rights .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we call &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal ra@@ inf@@ all of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week occur@@ ren@@ ces happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments have changed since Muslim economic migrants come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native of Papua , m@@ um@@ my &#91; the women &#93; of Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his electoral campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers pier@@ ced their tone and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ ts , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young women , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting arches and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - im@@ itating in a circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document by TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ aking , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his multi @-@ coloured wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ aking still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , bears only one name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ ie Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that their officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; filtered &quot; by Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he would establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical violations of human rights .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua had already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fierce stead@@ fast@@ ness .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes says . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military looked for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
&quot; on Tuesday , Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between the villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital . &quot;
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said the villa@@ gers threw rocks on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free Papua New Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of Papua by con@@ ta@@ gion spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ da Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily deta@@ ined in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty is boo@@ sting dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a , fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot;
agriculture is the task of women to deal with four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten specimen of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; for example , Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permit was given to them for filming . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ President of Human Rights Watch , the promise of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of coverage in order to promote transparency and development was not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai gun@@ fight . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights violations . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended by the Human Right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; in 2019 , Indonesia has another presidential election but the Papua people say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sho@@ oting @-@ Vic@@ tims carried out a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and scre@@ aming the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down@@ stairs , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage suffered from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said they believed that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) went through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup sole proposed for this sport was only to play two wins , not thin enough supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ pack classics are preserved to the traditional judgement . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not until the vote , the proposal came after many in@@ consisten@@ cies before the proposal to carry out the final at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new starting in 2018 is only comparatively small details : in the next year , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements for training stations etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; air passengers survey found that more than 20 per cent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items must be smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they accidentally wore prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people - that was carried out by a Jet Charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers tended to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents who admitted that they were know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent stated , unknow@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it questioned travellers around the country to find out how many accidentally had smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had done it inten@@ tional .
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who are most smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry through the security , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of the objects seized by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that the T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k happily announces with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customer has already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ous figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k reveals another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing figure for the first time on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the number of cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition has just begun . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that they are non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
his argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; all models should be combined in 2018 - 500@@ ,000 , a million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum work@@ load . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , if there are major delays , then the in@@ binding of reservations can become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw due to dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which expi@@ red on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone @-@ related o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year , in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who before being appointed by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Appe@@ als Court ruled in Washington that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards would simply simply reinforce the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to meet dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we take the law and the authority we give ourselves seriously .
&quot; however , the opinion of the EPA said that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt would use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group wanted to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; inver@@ ting the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the 115 million Americans directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil @-@ o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
public health representatives and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ e &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue to fight against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests .
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the 6th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and pat@@ rons of tum@@ ul@@ ling their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Platz for the first time : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ bled together with the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the original document , on the hill of Tum@@ ski , except for the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the patron was right and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ our , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the dominant population centre of the village . &quot;
&quot; old maps , dating back to 1600 , are supported by these historical facts . &quot;
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age came from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a master who built a church , ref@@ unded and occupied with a priest , remained owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
it was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was broken down at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was then ring@@ ed for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed off later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bel@@ ong@@ ings were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ my Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ welding . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke out the church tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius installation by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as a promot@@ er , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc invite to the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , 16 July . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gramm@@ ar School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
chief Apostle Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the closing words .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
&quot; to end the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organisers put out the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade will only take place in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ors and listeners . &quot;
the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the care of home care such as the seren@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , because at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a form error . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning conditions , the granted approval decision remains illegal and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council decided to re @-@ enter the wind@@ ward zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a hom@@ olog@@ ation of the district government is still pending .
&quot; explan@@ atory : &quot; in this respect , the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind energy plants is legally prec@@ lu@@ ded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been entered into the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; a spokes@@ man explained . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter once more .
&quot; however , they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the arguments of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , is planning to build four 200 @-@ meter @-@ high wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large area . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies at a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was injured in a fatal accident .
two more people were easily injured .
the national road was blocked for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her passenger car , travelled with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and merchants plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ berg and local people will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre . &quot;
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to l@@ ure the residents to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for what offers their own city holds away from the usual supermarket merchandise . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves to their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center invite to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed pou@@ ches that point to the action weekend , Christian König . &quot;
the Municipal Auth@@ orities and the Gewerbe@@ verein cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; this means that the commercial association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive Centre &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for the well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be newly or re @-@ opened . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping .
&quot; in the end everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; with a network of le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , it was re@@ warding to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that had spread in part , King had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen announced that five Thurin@@ gian cities are participating in the nationwide third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action taking place under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

&quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new further people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. City Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire department , there was still a last in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .

the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a matter of accident , the authorities presum@@ ed to work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people stayed in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
Tr@@ ump continued after scre@@ ened tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president sum@@ mon@@ ed him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and turned to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside , the in@@ mates were ho@@ vering in fear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ am tore the silence , as a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; luckily this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a pos@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were re@@ considered by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights lawyer .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ ordination serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want law enforcement , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI agents received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one has ever been accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on a free footh@@ old for decades , citizens of civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court rendered it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com has a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they got away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , cleared of evidence , and has covered the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you have registered , and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene managed the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivi@@ dly , gri@@ pping and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep racism , many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look at , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ch because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ ist for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ sta@@ Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high ester scre@@ ams and p@@ ushes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; He , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out laughing .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time have said &apos; n --- he &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; said one of the other black actors . &quot;
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition finishes violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman dressed in mourning is over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos;s mour@@ n@@ ful speech &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot;
the audience is split up evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks carries her on a pilgrimage to the burial places of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song ring out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children squ@@ at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his opponents and then breaks together in her arms . the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; said one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience joins the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair ch@@ ats from Atlanta to talk about the post with a black couple whom they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was struggling to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard at his table , eating and remember@@ ing the civil rights . &quot;
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ creation is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ ma@@ ge@@ d@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo in the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhin@@ eland @-@ De@@ ad@@ ders pose as a rock energies , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil drums remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ motiv - Money , Power and Gi@@ ver - which moves through his &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhin@@ e@@ aters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; at K@@ ESS , they dec@@ eive Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag a cor@@ pse into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and enter the Kra@@ mp@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the deli@@ ght@@ fully fri@@ ghtful Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight bo@@ xer .
brut@@ ally the scene when he was shocked .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe in it . &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with a powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ m@@ ingly , who hum@@ bly bow down and bend their hands towards Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat , again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team had been eag@@ erly anticipated .
&quot; in 2013 , he had still had to leave a part of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concert for himself , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the individual &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about that .
&quot; it was noted that the audience had grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; not only did the audience make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of their view . &quot;
I draw a positive resume .
Max number works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to find anywhere ?
&quot; crowd : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at school in the open day of the whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
lot : I did a high school diploma .
&quot; and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successful abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , make a social worker education and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?

it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .

&quot; Pear@@ son cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressures the company faces . &quot;
&quot; job reductions , the general director John Fall@@ on mainly announced at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 points have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the business year remained unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : killed by NATO soldier on suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and announced a NATO Declaration .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last act of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; people @-@ made impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the Group , known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bomb was killed by at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had launched this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is weighing up the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the cr@@ ot@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to working with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colom@@ bian district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump is supposed to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; the efforts , however , have triggered the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and conserv@@ atories wor@@ rying about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone will reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ x@@ ns announces the establishment of a joint space in the future residential community . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; although the area is still owned by the church community , it will not be a planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat is offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council ho@@ vers in front of seeing such a common room as a meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget , will be made possible by funding opportunities last autumn . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ ade , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this regard there is no bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both saddle - which is le@@ aned against the surrounding conditions - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , is this additive . &quot;
&quot; when it helps , he passes the committee unanim@@ ously . &quot;
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of her own buildings with whom one does not get so much forward , but now she is lean in the common room from the window , she says , &quot; I &apos;m very hard with it . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , as with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value which is market@@ able in doubt , is the opposite . &quot;
&quot; according to Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request to request the proposed resolution , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; it remains with two opposing voices in the original programme , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; if we put the decision in such a way , we make a giant leap forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling around 12.@@ 20@@ h by bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from direction Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the land of Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite . &quot;
he met a car that was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting wagon .
FC Bayern Munich must do without Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the World Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup runs without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with staff care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the tro@@ phy winner .
&quot; before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the sta@@ ff@@ ing staff at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger at the cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical state and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added , &quot; The most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory match of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans out .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
immig@@ rate to Stern in the Harz
&quot; in the resin , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
the association Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg plans to do this .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; comes to meet the need for information from many of the visitor &apos;s visitors .
&quot; he unites nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in the upper resin . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ ei@@ sel and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tablets should be supplemented by the Internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was more lumin@@ ous than another , although it was much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot;
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the Ha@@ in@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun &apos;s exactly 75 meters away is measuring 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is a good four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star however would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ fe@@ ather champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ stage world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down among fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; declared Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I got up for bronze &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to lightweight .
and he must move to light@@ wei@@ lers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko ple@@ aded .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko needs to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23rd . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he estimates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko lec@@ tured at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side is very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ end . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show punch strength then boxes . &quot;
both said they could sense the momentum they built up for their own struggle .
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire burst
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was suspended in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; the three chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the start of the season against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to work better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a kick @-@ off , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch themselves any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better with the three @-@ chain preparation , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is certain of his cause , &quot; because we just have players in the three chain at half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not achieve so many play@@ things in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also moves to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can &apos;t talk about a failed start after a draw , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at present , &quot; says the inner defense of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) final stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as boss coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by the Swedish asylum seekers application tests
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) began the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some of the refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; to date , migration sales have sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det proc@@ eeded to study the 5@@ 81 results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , where X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot say it sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson at the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ strasse 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , manager at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the construction is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is an arch bridge made of concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the other two bridges run across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side .
&quot; this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 @-@ meter wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian path is to run .
&quot; the special part is that it deals with finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berg company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a particular sense of finger @-@ tip has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
&quot; in the run @-@ up to the work , the residents were informed about the project . &quot;
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collective farm in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridge compens@@ ations amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest in German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which would otherwise be difficult to reconci@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the circle of volcanic ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on that day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big election campaign . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ bel , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land formed the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing at a table &quot; &quot; was planned on the well square , but now takes place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the decisive organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and a lot of food , including a &quot; ancient potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano Ei@@ fel reports that he took care of such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , the main thing , it stays peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at 8 o &apos;clock in the forec@@ our@@ t , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ bel , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to keep their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 9@@ pm . &quot;
the police can press down - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one hits trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ ho@@ und Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konzerte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ er at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo orchestra of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend together into a fascinating complete artwork . &quot;
this piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg this spring with a huge success .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart , openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was her &quot; &quot; twi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin portra@@ ys the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with every one I had . &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d played it ?
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that it was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or ham@@ pered me .
I never really liked being taken seriously .
&quot; she especially suffered under &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but during the school @-@ time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to act in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump stating that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice endor@@ sed not the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states , and inherited a coal business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us than working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again . &quot;
&quot; during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , Russian athle@@ tics boss , D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin , said that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes who have won gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
the entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; in the next few months , we have to do everything to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
soldiers crashed in Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian district of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers have fallen in front of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the un@@ explained down@@ fall .
&quot; they described the two opposite drivers , however , as &quot; experts of their trade . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ erh@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week in Mali .
&quot; her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and , on Thursday , accompanied by a Tot@@ en@@ vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter . &quot;
at noon only the members of the church took leave .
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives standing arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ anic .
the chief captain of the staff used the flight operation of the battle helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , said , &quot; &quot; If this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister von der Le@@ yen did not show : the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Federal Ar@@ med Forces did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik is not going to be grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already produced a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flo@@ ated , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of be@@ ers , sil@@ ks instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and didn &apos;t feel ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprise ignation of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the parliamentary elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ wei@@ r founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his group to welcome them .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the opposite has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether or not to go@@ vern this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l holds it indispensable , however , that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on their further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be examined legally properly , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally properly examined .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ ern@@ ens step &quot; but a little curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a bearer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country parliament .
&quot; we do , of course , assume that they will have immediate effect on their land mandate , which they have received via the green state list , &quot; &quot; said the regional chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Green Party , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ wei@@ r extraordinarily . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to speak any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ stepping of the Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ wei@@ r to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; the German Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament &apos;s parliament .
the exit of T@@ own@@ es costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; in her final vanity and in her fru@@ stration are her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat it political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ wei@@ r in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election with personal car@@ eers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD most powerful force , SPD and Green Party had a waf@@ er @-@ thin majority of one voice during the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Herr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers be protected ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Schmidt : how can the consumer protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health risk is practically impossible . &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really noticed by the German Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has switched inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the acceptance of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has as much concern as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
&quot; if the level limit of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not easily accessible . &quot;
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the farms are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the present knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it missing only on the personnel or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
there were just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be present are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made a clear statement that I expect a lack of information from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ arms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are ri@@ dden . &quot;
&quot; by means of the company , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect all the relevant authorities , that the facts are quickly and comprehen@@ sively clari@@ fied . &quot;
how the football rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious champi@@ ons league tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can easily make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich royal family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may use a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate income sources that allow them to break even point in their activities related to the football . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that clubs which had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini was dis@@ gra@@ ced by the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption price for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ical company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market records , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come over payments of the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador is going to be and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be simply figur@@ ing out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to compl@@ ying with any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not competent to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the agreement .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board cho@@ col@@ ates chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is at the end of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report by the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will fin@@ alize a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y supplier , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; each year , approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packaged chocolate panels distribute to 14 grams each year before landing to the passengers prior to landing . &quot;
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information on the cost .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in line with &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a shock producer .
the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new call .
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be contacted for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates distribute chocolate bars on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge period ( as the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the etch @-@ comedy &quot; &quot; The State &quot; &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by stiff@@ ening on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play gh@@ ost@@ ly children , who will grow up - yet they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults now playing adult , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy is more based on the casting principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand Cra@@ ck@@ les the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point is an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates , and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gra@@ cious co@@ op ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy , malign@@ ant plot that is included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( including Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ sung impression by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s side@@ burns of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old st@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random ins@@ anity that this fran@@ chise may heat up like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminded of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East @-@ West Ring@@ ling I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice tags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time to watch chess on TV as Americans perhaps do with football ) .
&quot; the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so deeply involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; in six long episodes , the comedy is gone , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited to a lesser degree , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything possible for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs .
strike against Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest District , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; in addition , the civil servants ensured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; during the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
&quot; in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organized drug de@@ crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating Kon@@ stanz against the organised drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand Mission was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals combined with the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s account . &quot;
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the alien register
&quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner register in Germany has substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to a media report on large gaps in the foreign @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in a way that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; had been present . &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data were found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faulty data entry can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; states the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such false attri@@ butions led to a distorted debate about dealing with tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have immig@@ rated from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to this , the paper stated that BA@@ MF is carrying out such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , the state can send it back to the territory . &quot;
&quot; now the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also return refugees in the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ pa , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening illegal admission conditions and a danger of child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in total , 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ cher@@ bach was already available to other people . &quot;
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , who were honoured on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who in the meantime has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the community acknowled@@ ges the majority of willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are created for this and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , not sel@@ fl@@ ess , &quot; emphasized mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house resulted in higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rel were among the multiple don@@ ors and received 50 donated blood donations for each of them . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter paid ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected later to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members in this month reluct@@ ant to boost growth , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but it sign@@ aled that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation that had been heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of credit could possibly exceed more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February , even though it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households remains subject to consumption . &quot;
&quot; at interest rates , she repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first surge in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised down@@ wards for this and next year will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the Bank forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to not change after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on interest rate increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months rose to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will slightly recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report showed little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal increase in wages , as the tigh@@ tening will first get worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy can not &quot; &quot; prevent the income drop &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pound . &quot;
&quot; the bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose higher , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers asking for an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said this was expected and will be put on again in the coming months . &quot;
the bank said that the exceed@@ ance in relation to its target of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the recent roll@@ out of swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescri@@ be HIV drug addic@@ ted to 10.000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment after a fight against the High Court in September after a fight against the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ surgery pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines being taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or as much as two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in hospitals , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , as used on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed specifically on needy and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and termin@@ ate the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former Bank@@ erin with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the Architecture and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12@@ ,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to release the award . &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend .
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or down . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses by Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art came into it , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter @-@ important , so that when you push the door high , it is very easily gli@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here they have succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor space and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something quite amazing .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers struggling for a 500 million US dollar property empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of Victori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate empire worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the family West@@ co founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 to $ 85 million .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; &quot; Princip@@ al operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot;
a court file states that this means Col@@ in &apos;s property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Col@@ in , such as Paul asser@@ ts , has expelled him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held lawyers . &quot;
&quot; Mrs De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ wareh@@ ouses of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; he often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark paid $ 10 million while leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , according to Paul , had become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t say much &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul chose to acc@@ use me and draw up our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s demands .

new Chief of Staff Tr@@ ump plans to limit the president &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece by Repor@@ ters Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information falling into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame junk by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; at the time , Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ ump Twitter habit controlled , according to six former electoral campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that tr@@ umps twe@@ ets could have even more ignition sources without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
&quot; if his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times , then their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that may encourage their views from the world . &quot;
Politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply desperate information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks and that he stiff@@ ens to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy director of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ ane , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he alle@@ ges false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot;
these inv@@ ari@@ able factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
&quot; in this summer , the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals . &quot;
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; advent calendar .
&quot; the experience showed that many fle@@ eting of holiday destinations hide , was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
we have compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ east@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online con@@ fessions have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications of publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Number &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners in West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on the foot of the war , tra@@ ded by a community drawn from the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s Ran@@ ges . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were released in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their attacks . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; ra@@ ging residents have pushed Soli@@ hull &apos;s advice , saying that it is &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back now . &quot;
&quot; more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of this trav@@ eller , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible notify an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise comes from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenues by the local tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building offered the County Council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council . &quot;
&quot; but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location , and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he was right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Executive Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof located in front of the entrance for some time now , and when entering the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are undertaken . &quot;
&quot; floors have been torn down , ceilings partly broken down , old bath tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; until March , there is still a lot to do . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
we want to make a piece of jewellery .
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and conference room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated inner city level , emphas@@ ises sha@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already talked with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the noti@@ ons of the city were similar to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special investig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury upon a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Board of Directors received the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people who were familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper received the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between the former son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interven@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller explores if there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump Contest team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ors of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans during the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a close look at a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Sonder@@ er@@ gene@@ alog@@ ist Tr@@ ump went to the centre and under@@ mine the accus@@ ation whether the president might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible violations and decide whether to apply charges .
&quot; for this reason , Grand Jury are also called accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge individuals for interro@@ gation .
&quot; according to CN@@ N , invitations have been issued that revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; in the report , people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former electoral campaign leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort took part in the interview . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening in US television , legal experts said that the establishment shows that Mu@@ eller does not allow himself to be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
the theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about .
&quot; his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he does not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but I usually work in the secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures , which accelerated the work of the special investig@@ ator in &quot; &quot; fair &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not to be determined against the president .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was called in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this draft , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud ; he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey was in front of a Senate Committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him for an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investig@@ ator and its employees . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulations on whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be fired .
&quot; unlike an independent special investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later res@@ igned president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired upon the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; on Thursday , two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation that could not be dismissed as easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the west Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has settled down from the ice shelf . &quot;
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the Kol@@ oss , weighing over 1 tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
&quot; however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the col@@ os@@ sus broken now has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it always grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf there .
&quot; there are some indications that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger , because the front edge has never gone as far back as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks off at a key location . &quot;
the melting of ice cream and ic@@ eber@@ gs does not elev@@ ate the sea level as they float on the water and hold ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice sheet causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth @-@ largest shelf @-@ file of the Antar@@ ctic with nearly 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e would now grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if the researchers did not re@@ trace this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg down to climate change , many glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and t@@ ames it to the areas in which the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants ho@@ ist tari@@ ff at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls on the employers association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous day has passed 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have completed their first working day . &quot;
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously highly cov@@ eted .
&quot; for this year , some 6@@ 20 applications were to be registered . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
currently there are still 50 un@@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
&quot; among other things , the search for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative , together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the parties &quot; desire , the administration should &quot; develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented in@@ wards and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ star@@ ters and include a training initiative , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good start .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities hire good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , who are absent from the service due to disease or age . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is high time for action so that not even more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Kol@@ b , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he took care of a big surprise already in the working day , when he questioned the number of personnel costs and the other parties ba@@ ff@@ led . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the surrounding cities - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than the public service fee actually fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone of NGO Mig@@ rant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; , &quot; because their team had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , declined to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can assess all accus@@ ations that are currently le@@ vi@@ ed after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue missions , have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti says in the meantime , that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali for measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine wick@@ er bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Ou@@ ter out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy riding and sightseeing . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - und W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als reward . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to sal@@ ine and the folk festival sau@@ sage market . &quot;
&quot; again there was a look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , there was again a lot of altitude difference . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed the cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also contro@@ led .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sports
are the sport stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of getting bored during wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high sums included . &quot;
&quot; the first federal li@@ ga@@ des , which are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognised this . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that there are still some clubs rising on this train .
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Federation FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; in London , where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal particularly with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian . &quot;
&quot; with celeb@@ r@@ ity e @-@ athletes under contract , you could be far more present on these markets online than once a year to send the German embassy to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just FIFA &apos;s football simulation are fought at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , li@@ lies have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is definitely getting used to the ordinary . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to reaction . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing . &quot;
the scientist clearly highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
&quot; players are travelling internationally , it &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the company consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to rise to 130 million . &quot;
this is little about the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot;
international are many countries already .
&quot; great markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports team . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition suppliers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
things are happening in Europe as well .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ inia . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football league &apos;s first @-@ league football clubs are now under obligation to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times is not enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t hold on to the fact that only in football , everything remains as it was . &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy tries to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through lyrics and calls for suicide .
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was condemned in June due to the neg@@ ligent death of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and eyes looking down when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they regret .
&quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I am not bet@@ ting the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity , to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad , &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was looking at the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is not by chance .
the FC Bayern did a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation was not hur@@ ting there .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ und and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the attachment to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the winner of the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
good that could have run better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also point to Kim@@ i .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was made up of young players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday , but he was chosen as a player . &quot;
&quot; sugar is best distributed to those who want to drink a lot , which you want to keep in a good mood . &quot;
so those who were chosen to return the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; Kim@@ ber@@ ley confirmed , &quot; That &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flew over the field as a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot;
&quot; right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one , who can take the helm at the best . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to steer the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe .
&quot; he had a look to the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal therefore , to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fold hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out of the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus , in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ cot won &apos;t be neg@@ atively imp@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game build @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game store , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two interviews , but definitely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said good bye to his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ mar &apos;s speed
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sig ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously add the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the desires of the economy that has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us , the biggest down@@ turn , sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top in the priority list of the country . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Ministry is hoping for a plan for planning , until 2021 will be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also takes place in the West Bank of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Highway Research Plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ feld , Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier stri@@ ves , as is the case of Wis@@ ser , an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sig has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , the Chamber of Industry pra@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium of 1,000 euros for the passed master examination and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of master education . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , but at the same time there is no need for the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , 56 new engineers who want to set up knowledge in the field of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility have only been filled with 29 jobs . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; member of the CD@@ U , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us is expecting a concept of the country as to how it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK pol@@ l with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she cleared the field for discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group president stated that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving constraints , &quot; and embark@@ ed on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as a call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ab@@ using the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but re@@ trac@@ ted under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Audi &apos;s engine development in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , those who pass the Is@@ ar will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the construction department wants to clarify .
&quot; on the raft , one sees a large Inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter . &quot;
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is meant to shar@@ pen as a worthy game of ven@@ ison . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft continued over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los no@@ od@@ le n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist he was , among other things , depicted as a carto@@ graphic artist - what fru@@ strated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made the breakthrough at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , round Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still alive today , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread widely worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that will come into the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is reproduced without word . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change from Provence
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is decreasing due to the conditions remin@@ ding of drought , and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great headache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only attracted by holiday@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
&quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the solutions taken into account include better water distribution and slow@@ ing evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ dol@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral ones , allies . &quot;
you ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ el , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses pile up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and its inspiration from Ri@@ dol@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared issues , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely tried by journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ dol@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is still more pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez opened the office of the newspaper Ri@@ dol@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot twelve times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; for a minute , forget that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el controls the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug @-@ trading routes to the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ dol@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to comp@@ el Val@@ dez , following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; in 2003 , he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ dol@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing any problem of nar@@ cot@@ ics , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to publish hard examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it carried . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take the task which you as journalist , either that or you are playing the dum@@ b . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ dol@@ ce team is missing Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted their routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine destruction ?
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to best do their job , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret starting and run@@ ways , in order to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not lawful , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells bad , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ dol@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ dol@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central @-@ sized neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the Gover@@ nor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters went into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce ble@@ w three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the former known fighter Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures which concentrated on the home town of the governor .
&quot; and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping carried out . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter found out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , which belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few signs and walked the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ dress disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der over the country by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and om@@ itting them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has attributed more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were lying next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that drug traffi@@ cking scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ dol@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tape riv@@ ets and security forces close to Maz@@ at@@ lan beach , had left 19 confirmed dead . &quot;
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ b@@ side edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ dol@@ ce via mobile . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens stood nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept the guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ dol@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day when Ja@@ vier was assass@@ inated , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in Current Bi@@ ology described him as &quot; the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was buried on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and do@@ dge its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it &quot; &quot; Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli &quot; &quot; to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours of discovering it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r has been hun@@ ted by din@@ osau@@ rs by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; powerful predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal for information about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal contents to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when enormous thermal opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived for millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings are published in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned in the sea after death and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was buried on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were resting from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ser was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater cre@@ mation kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good that the cut@@ ters cover still b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a winning in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometre @-@ long jams - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first statements of the police , between 17@@ .00 and 17@@ .00 , between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) there were almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of injuries . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man said it was light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large amount of rescue vehicles were charged at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre return was formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z journalist reports , there was also a massive disability on the opposite track - through numerous g@@ aff@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ gade took note of the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ bars , which are now to be expected with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 another accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : company tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is immersed in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ted or tear@@ ing the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the name of the train ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some pre@@ conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
&quot; it is also necessary to purchase the DB Navig@@ ator by train , which is the most convenient ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : one goes into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation then appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seating place Y .
&quot; when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket control at No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket inspection by our train crew , you simply check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who travel by train often know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed to de@@ grade online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussion between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to poor atmosphere in the section or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
more conc@@ ise numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; &quot; Are Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed her Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ar@@ ded on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ ell thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone off in order to return to T@@ we@@ et via people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police band and people crying , and by a man who claimed to be the father of Brow@@ ns who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman told his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; Ferr@@ ell rec@@ alled at her testimony . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt shi@@ vering . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11@@ pm , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the topic of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Ferr@@ ell and her daughter , wearing a cau@@ lif@@ lower and a fitting crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , they discussed a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; over the black experience and the black condition &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; Fer@@ ran said later . &quot;
what is happening today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not just activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Ferr@@ ell and her daughter were associated with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
a question came up with Ferr@@ ell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ?
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ but@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Ferr@@ ell closer to the project , along with six other natives followed by the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who talks to us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , for this is how I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not about a Messiah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ ran said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions held the movement altogether , &quot; Fer@@ ry said , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held up by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action &quot; , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was chosen as the heart of the film as a result of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands so much in the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; however , she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV viewers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
&quot; but since the first presentation of 2009 , the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the topic rarely leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while one says to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ ste ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , of which the rest of the shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery will be exactly planned on the plot , on which the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
&quot; the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the farmers market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes made by the rural women always very gladly . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also possible .
&quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are plenty of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market there , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , as the tenants there are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of them will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the farmers market hall be built during construction time ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the gh@@ o@@ sts bit gallery already manage to distribute all the business from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it will simply not work .
&quot; and no one needs a shopping center , which is empty . &quot;
&quot; in my view it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmer &apos;s market there is no place in Bit@@ burg thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; many faces can be seen in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ner and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after revealing a secret diplom@@ at about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and a tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing dissi@@ dent whose conviction was changed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary , not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with whom she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg emerged from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in it , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum , by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she could not be photographed at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were turned into un@@ equal glasses , which changed several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ lement Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would be converted to Over@@ seas Jud@@ gement and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; indeed , that Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand was a welcome type of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump is conducting a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways in order to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As . written in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similar , at least in biological regards , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with us is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel . &quot;
&quot; it shows man@@ ing , as it appears with a hands @-@ free sp@@ ying gun in the hands of the disciplinary collections of the United States like King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted her from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which unite like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford were sought for killing
a nationwide human hunting is in progress for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died 26 , after several en@@ grav@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; a common warning system , published by the Chicago Police Authority , states that the body was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the place of action , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ them@@ um had now been in scrut@@ iny and excluded from entering the University of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of her where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate her reinforce &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help the susp@@ ects . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building who had just gotten a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that both lay and war@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA driving plan in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA driver plan was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA driving schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t know anything about Russia &apos;s cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the examination approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ko said in terms of the matter : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has gotten a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has tried to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was expelled from the WA@@ DA as part of the D@@ oping scandal of the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , Chief Executive Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs for the time being
the company groups shared this .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could further be assumed by no health impairment , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been proven to be negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lum@@ bar . &quot;
Al@@ di wanted to make clarity and transparency with his customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your business do not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people out of the outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources start @-@ ups is wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys done by certain teams , it offers a heat chart of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low cons@@ ents results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ ve why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this request is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Finance technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ gence , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ kol@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; scent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ ish allows companies to send customised &quot; &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company finds its employees poorly treated or beha@@ ves in@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ gence for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ nis@@ m , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair plac@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical off@@ ences caused by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online .
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ nis@@ s@@ offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of venture capital investors that have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ gence received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners , and secured its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments . &quot;
employees want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which used both Con@@ ver@@ gence and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the changes are not fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; Have you really listened to me ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after gathering feedback from fru@@ strated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the workforce and hopes that in the long run , this leads to better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey over@@ lays and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school , for the first time during Mor@@ as , six playing times were practi@@ sed in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
20 minutes before the beginning of formal game preparations for their ki@@ ck@@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he support the amend@@ ment of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if it adds another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they &apos;re going on , they &apos;re great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which is due to the clear si@@ ght@@ ings of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been be@@ ached with foot@@ balls leaving a safety net behind a door@@ post , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room and then setting up an exercise there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video wall from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles to third @-@ party fake reports and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors , which may display results of the Fak@@ tum review from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly remove h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the At@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shire one with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expectedly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting a little &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena @-@ pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape pla@@ sters , gar@@ dening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key , &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing who had what had happened : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it child that the Dar@@ r@@ ell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; the S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is portrayed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; lords seemed to be a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell @-@ men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ lords . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his en@@ rol@@ ment in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel on E@@ lä@@ ker@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready again with dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign started : covering over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the wra@@ pping of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; asked the makers of the action yesterday at the pla@@ ques at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t think so ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their website which was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; with the action , it is about more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one which gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they are competing with other local authorities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost up its new umbrella brand and the campaign for an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year , at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts about reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week too .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the numbers . &quot;
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who Erdo@@ gan as a wire pul@@ ler of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara is negotiating for this week in Ankara . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated a coup attempt as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on the head@@ scar@@ f for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale teaching in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 star@@ ters , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform regulations of the European Union . &quot;
ex officers say that Erdo@@ gan is driving forces to Islam@@ ize the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; it intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by giving the US the way people are spent in other countries green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new review procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for racing shuttle
&quot; over and over again , over the past few months , the future of the racing shuttle has been cont@@ ested - now it should go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the road on which the tourist train runs will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the pav@@ ement sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the route should begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue to order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection above all for tourism , &quot; declared public secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country will take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the timet@@ able , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of 11 years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation over the past few months , it has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is heavily damaged in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) has published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies are delivering a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
but it becomes even more alar@@ ming as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look progressive a step@@ ford @-@ woman .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ling . &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; that gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , if one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troub@@ le@@ free one . &quot;
&quot; on its website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy has a vibr@@ ator but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just simply another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not keep any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is crossed out of the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women are worldwide threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most frigh@@ tening aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos; T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the dev@@ oured body and the out @-@ si@@ ghted eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ pop proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human@@ ly that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you cannot separate or simply walk away from your companion .
&quot; they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the 2017 speech : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of sound human understanding
&quot; it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Er@@ a that political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , have split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of their elec@@ ting relatives .
we are all trying to make our filter bags burst .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the repub@@ lican kin@@ ship with which she strug@@ gled for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same page . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but in a further context it seems to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the Left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we talk of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s Fut@@ ur@@ gical Version of the Cra@@ zy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans has to be spiritually healthy to qualify as an un@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ry and the animals twist in order to look full of fear over their own shoulders . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage matters not - but a big round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ el is still a strange magic experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have scored the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ ert pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ used as I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was hospit@@ alized because of the treatment of cuts to his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first dead @-@ death sentence after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp during the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to present this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the districts of Sag@@ itt@@ arius and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental House in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grows up in the poultry farm , but then released to freedom . &quot;
&quot; to do so , the m@@ ous@@ y band performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it breed from his chickens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him was sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain . &quot;
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z .
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ dd@@ les , the cylinders wore to make the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for the integration , said director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ person vessel that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; it was followed by a letter of thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps into Unter@@ richt@@ sen@@ g@@ p@@ äs@@ sen , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time was over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher announced . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she did not leave her students very reluct@@ ant , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the fourth @-@ grade wat@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in the process , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ grade aqu@@ educ@@ ators have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were deta@@ ined for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , a group of people illeg@@ ally inv@@ aded by the police was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; in the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
&quot; they should improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 , and some Euro 6 . &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine from the ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no . the software updates that are tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have become the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to address any affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within its framework . &quot;
how long will the change@@ over@@ s take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE says to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
does a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 vehicles now threaten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
&quot; in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;
the ace advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J is awarded Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first R@@ apper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ orable . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; the award winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear her point of view .
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after the former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the previous award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re in retirement in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker is a city builder for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him as he medi@@ ates during the press conference .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
&quot; at the earliest possible date , the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer . &quot;
&quot; according to the regular periods of notice , this should still be enough time for a famili@@ arization . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub @-@ law office for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must submit appropriate conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer be able to fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is sure of the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ will have been encountered . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium refurb@@ ishment is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will be charged with around € 1.5 million , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city builder . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own farm yard and landsc@@ aping , it can be re@@ acted quite flexibly on a variety of occasions . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the ol@@ d@@ town as an ensemble stands under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what &quot; fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city builder emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city builder is responsible for a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a client , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; in the case of care and coordination , he can count on many years of co @-@ operation : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if anyone wants to bury Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach , a completed degree course should be presented as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Construction Office under@@ goes civil engineering , civil engineering , structural planning , under@@ tak@@ ings , administration of urban properties , municipal yard with building yard and city landsc@@ aping , as well as under the protection of buildings and monuments . &quot;
bike on cables thrown : South track closed
&quot; according to police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway slide crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators depart from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night hours .
&quot; close to the crime scene , a rose and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond the region of Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ator , would have brought himself into great danger and also end@@ angers the traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and equipment , as well as the delay of the delay and the costs for rail transport , even pat@@ rons of the railway customers could be transferred to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; substantial sum &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern track could be run without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten people were on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not come out , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study suggests just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; it suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investig@@ ates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separate , this did not . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ases of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacteria species found in mice with immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were re@@ trac@@ ted in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria imp@@ acted on the immune system , researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s food , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. Cru@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot;
&quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had made his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the keeper &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; matic , however , had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho ad@@ mits he had to improve before the beginning of the premi@@ er league season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent contained in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association for that , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing used such advertising in the past .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD chief , S &amp; D Prime Minister glan@@ ced at elections with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only there was no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - that was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were grav@@ ings .
one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably governed , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprise group @-@ president of a Green MP has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the parliamentary elections , its red @-@ green coalition with it lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apo@@ state Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ wei@@ r to give her mandate back .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ire must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Green Party editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD election milit@@ ant si@@ gh@@ ed , when the new press message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the departure of the Green MP El@@ ke T@@ wei@@ r . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ er started with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades were cal@@ ming at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
that &apos;s what it became - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the ca@@ vern , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
in the weeks after that the comrades worked ti@@ ously .
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was reached from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next deep beat came .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD president of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he did not do anything wrong , which can be done wrong . &quot;
Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival ever since .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ type and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has long been under criticism . &quot;
the survey results were added .
&quot; still , or maybe because of this , Wei@@ l was trying to set accents in the federal government in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings . &quot;
they let him grant him a stabil@@ isation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party @-@ internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz no longer at all .
&quot; for the time being , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ westen combined her own career prospects over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ wei@@ r hasn &apos;t been elected a direct candidate because of her personality , but on the regional list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , such as the Lower Saxony parliament . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; willingness four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , who led the Lower Saxony SPD to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ for@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he demanded that the background be clari@@ fied .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been more promises of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding money for centre @-@ core III
those who want to renov@@ ate his home in the years will soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development reported on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been sensi@@ cal re@@ development areas . &quot;
&quot; back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous restructuring is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote internal development as well and not only to develop new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the government presi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a re@@ development area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros would come from the country , the rest from the community . &quot;
how is the area of rehabilitation ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area whatsoever , to refurb@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could then also be moved again . &quot;
&quot; the stamp represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the content of the &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; federal government programme , in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program is rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the re@@ development area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the licensing period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 to April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , the inventory will be carried out only once , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area , a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the stat@@ ute should be made as far as possible , so that in the coming year it can be started with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every commun@@ e had to carry out the ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned preventive examinations .
&quot; the aim is to evaluate and determine the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances , when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
&quot; for the respective property , there will be a letter in the land register as well . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ tsch@@ eber stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it deals with the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; information on size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; is to be filled only when operating in the building business premises . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new building measures are not eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stresses that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , first grin@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t make funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; City II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; tasty &quot; renovation . &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip to get a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the palaces of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event produced by American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers up to $ 24@@ ,000 in accordance with the military provided to the TI@@ ME Magazine . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all over 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was displayed next to a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire truck and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy marine commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message indicates that on July 17th , the helicopter arrived at 7 a.m. on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president announced a push for reform of health reform underway in the Senate and propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for travel .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump took an inspection in February when the presidential jet delivered before the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the president &apos;s plane through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to deal with the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on that day for non @-@ presidential missions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ed awards for the presidential charter , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and was jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky job
the leader of the Second World Tennis Bundes@@ liga comes to the third S@@ V championship in the championship .
TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss arrives tomorrow at 11 : 00 in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V in Kiel .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second World Tennis Bundes@@ liga was given the sense of the reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always playing in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; right on the back , I find the team very good . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the S@@ V , S@@ V , imports from the high North are primarily concerned . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets during the Davis Cup .
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ ag@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult for us as always . &quot;
&quot; you need a good dose of luck too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; if the Fren@@ ch@@ man active at the Chall@@ enger competition in the Italian Bi@@ ella does not match the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liber@@ ec in the Czech Republic will make its first use this season . &quot;
&quot; the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo , yesterday with the Bel@@ three V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski , was still on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team again . &quot;
&quot; is it enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the coach staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he launched his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the Congress reviewed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US push . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from O@@ MV , who co @-@ operate with other European companies , are worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Soul Board Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order . &quot;
twelve arms are available to him .
the press &quot; looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him .
&quot; Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el has moved into the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , who reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the Net@@ fli@@ x series has not been over for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ u@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ u@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1st September .
roll back : the town provides 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day nur@@ series .
&quot; as of September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; this is a good news for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department . &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
&quot; cooking is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task , and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates 46 day care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children receive a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last kit@@ ten year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served 45 weekly hours are eating at the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al @-@ time workers have kitchen service from 1 . September : they warm up the supplied food , add salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , leave the food off , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen workers now belong to the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita @-@ Team &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen strength to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be carried out by specialist cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of kitchen power , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self @-@ control and external procurement for the city as the most economical one . &quot;
and that although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ hired .
&quot; but these hours are not as strong as about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ om , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ elled to the provinces in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ ti@@ lities to an advisory role .
this year the elections will be handed over for the first time peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ om said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women have registered a total of registered 3.@@ 6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old talked to friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 pm , because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the girl &apos;s cell phone and the necklace of the girl , but this was mis@@ understood . &quot;

the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to as@@ certain its long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glas@@ gow at the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant producing Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich tea biscuits in addition to other products .
&quot; in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on &quot; &quot; express concerns that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t clear any clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glas@@ gow metrop@@ olitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react immediately , as we value the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continuously review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League likes to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar in its persecution after having sold a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to rede@@ em its exemp@@ tion clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season . &quot;
&quot; upon completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans suggests that the club always did his best to take care of him since he arrived from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi said . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator deliberately kno@@ cked down a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 , causing damage of more than 200 euros to the cl@@ adding of the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dge and tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was driving on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
&quot; in the area of the local circum@@ vention of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on the passenger car , property damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
according to the accident case it can be good that the car driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann believes .
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in front of the German press agency , as expected by former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the events .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; two standards &quot; were measured . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future , but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of nam@@ ing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also commented : &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a fe@@ eb@@ le fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a very normal pedago@@ gical tool , &quot; &quot; in order to cope with nau@@ ghty children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for the past decades , for the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the mem@@ ent@@ book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says E@@ zek@@ iel , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the B@@ ish@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ es sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , H@@ ann@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal caused by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ise on Prot@@ ected Fo@@ ols at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became handy when a cathedral @-@ spar@@ row did not bring top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gym@@ nasi@@ um on which he worked was perceived by almost all the respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; Bet@@ ter World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent testimony , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; and &quot; always sour@@ ced from grapes from children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only pop with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ files and drew too che@@ ek@@ y boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the period of time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you know these methods of cultivation ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us , who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually deals with in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are of course Bag@@ at@@ ellen . &quot;
one wonders whether it is not with his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media were just falling on him .
&quot; on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him are still eager to work . &quot;
the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the media reported a lot about mis@@ use at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is also accused of any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse . &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault alle@@ ges to have famili@@ ar@@ ised themselves with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of those people , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who , to a certain extent , had been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do you assess R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the context of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student said so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it has been calculated ... Bu@@ ben getting more intru@@ sive and clearer , or rather open compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation .
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to talk about any involvement . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link up his good name with these ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; looking away &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up became a huge p@@ lier of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , let &apos;s say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report treats incidents of the time since 1945 , including four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the child of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were almost victi@@ mi@@ zed and tortured , all of them acquired at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most of the witnesses pointed out , the subject &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have been stolen away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently give ear to the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral sp@@ litter grammar school , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties in Bavaria had long been banned . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us still knows . &quot;
it was difficult to estimate where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he would have always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the punishment of schools in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess was right .
&quot; but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times , and not for what was banned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s all aw@@ ful , and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally being processed . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ear fi@@ gs and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was banned , he was strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; Mein Brother der Papst &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of DU@@ T fine also contribute to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , the cathedral @-@ cats only played a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not know at all that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ sposition , true culture am@@ bass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with biscuits and sweets on your own , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys don &apos;t even make a great singer and before every success , regardless of the area , but still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks on her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experience again and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart @-@ good person , from which one can not imagine that he could also do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly see how many former Dom@@ sp@@ as today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly keep contact with him , visit him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is grateful to him for having enriched their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving respect person , to whom they still look up and honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all you submit to it are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
the evil intent behind it is only too apparent .
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the state would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
