<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-atlases, an offer of geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but topical - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for towns and communities more detailed maps, so-called urn sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian Pressurveying Authority between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops finally moved away with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours, who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian survey of surveying."</seg>
<seg id="19">The original document for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">"compared to early / today, the state capital is most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered Flurtees from the so-called" Urtaker, "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small parcels now occupy no more farmers there, but small farmers of the plant" land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the document, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" on the Gasteig "or from the height" On the ventilation "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüften" "was created there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Guden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up buying the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, there was first place, later expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was not sufficient any more - the reason for the construction of the Crotunda Club in Haar in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry centres, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Salesianum in Munich meet at the premises of the former Auer Institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was erected in an architectural basis on the original construction of the Irrenian Institution, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in 1856 the Marienplatz was listed as" "Main Square", "the shopping street was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allied bombs destroyed many of the holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the groundbreaking ceremony took place on 5 April 2017 for the second S-Bahn station."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group releases travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based occurrences occur in the whole country and are noted here," "states the Group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "a recently adopted Missouri law, making it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that are disproportionate on minorities, led the group to issue the warning," "said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard before.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel in the state during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of what could happen in Missouri," "said the Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to take care allowance or let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which ranks the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws that bind local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidefence project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-Stadt-association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the right-hand graveyard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted an insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housing the five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest milk "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also BLHV president of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area ensures a lot of work and much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not conduct bioactivity."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader's support. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could still be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their business," the mayor stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="83">"due to the promotion, farmers often stand in criticism"</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were enclosed in the electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open-air area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and maids."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiss also stated:" "here, the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state funding of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest intact.</seg>
<seg id="93">The requirement is the presence of a subsidy set by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the area to be fenced must not be smuggled (slopes above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fishermen electric fence project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a short distance of 16 kilometres, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the maintenance area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefree throw of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president's proposals for drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it resorted to its importance, and in particular the significance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller lies appropriately right, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your idleness, your arms, your oppressed masses, who longs to breathe freely, / the miserable wastes of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time when the" "waste" "was better seen on our screens."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict of the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, the people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame to the world around:" Lady Liberty is moving on. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not lighten the road, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black presents Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the UK's Athletics Championship, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special has been developed in Scotland" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out," Black said. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the team for team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her speech was incredible," Black says. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilidh naturally brought in, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400 m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total score for athletes at the World Championship was seven reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir runs along this road and last year posted five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that should be observed after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that she is" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but also in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on pods."</seg>
<seg id="155">As far as my speech as captain is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out and compete there, and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't mess around a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers proposed it all, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he leaked at criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"because in 1783 Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union sued it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a reciprocal reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement by the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news report "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same topic, then they are regarded by some rather as a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's employees referred to as" "concentrated spam" "attacks would probably be called" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest or to silence the demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she joined a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even back then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions criticizing his position on the treaty of Amity, trading and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua, including the Paniai gunfight."</seg>

<seg id="425">"Musk admits that a total of 518,000 pre-orders have already been retracted."</seg>

<seg id="440">"one day after being accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is about a deadline, which expired on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone-related ozone."</seg>
<seg id="444">"Pruitt declared in June that he would delay the observance of one year, in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth."</seg>

<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prusion regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Appeals Court ruled in Washington that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards would simply simply reinforce the willingness of the EPA to co-operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in its previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius' Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the 6th Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and patrons of tumulling their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Platz for the first time: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumbled together with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the original document, on the hill of Tumski, except for the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the patron was right and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which today are still visible in the townscape of Tumour, the" mountain "of the third, the dominant population centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">"old maps, dating back to 1600, are supported by these historical facts."</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage came from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a master who built a church, refunded and occupied with a priest, remained owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">It was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was broken down at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell was then ringed for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed off later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were inserted and the belongings were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tummy Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörwelding."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm broke out the church tower and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius installation by Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as a promoter, the friends and supporters of Tumarc invite to the old cemetery at St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16 July."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Grammar School Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Chief Apostle Hartmut Romann is talking about the closing words.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to end the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view. "</seg>

<seg id="504">Association wants to allow approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal requirements for the construction and therefore turned to the Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">"Boisheim" "Boisheim" "has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheim Nette, because at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a form error."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning conditions, the granted approval decision remains illegal and therefore also to be taken back," "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the city council decided to re-enter the windward zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a homologation of the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"explanatory:" in this respect, the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind energy plants is legally precluded. "</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letters have been entered into the circle of Viersen since last week," a spokesman explained. "</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion of reviewing the matter once more.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the arguments of the" Boisheim "association."</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary, is planning to build four 200-meter-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large area."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the establishment of the four wind turbines, electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in the end everyone would have to contribute to enliven the city centre - up to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs."</seg>

<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of state Georgia and a life-long civil rights lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the post-ordination serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI agents received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But no one has ever been accused.</seg>

<seg id="606">"it's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look at, but Greene said that is the point."</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the lynch because we are confronted with his ugliness in all of us," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I can't build a relationship with you, if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've done through."</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest blacks - pushed into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece."</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is a co-director here.</seg>
<seg id="611">"he has played the role of Chief Clanist for many years, but he said that the role will never be easier."</seg>

<seg id="613">But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times.</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room the actor DarstaBradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines."</seg>
<seg id="615">"the piece starts with Malcom, the high ester screams and pushes him, furiously that he slept with his wife Dorothy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said," "He, winch away from my property!" ""</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona reciprocates the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everybody (at least all black actors) breaks out laughing.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona. "</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," said Greene, still chuckling. "</seg>
<seg id="625">I simply don't think that white people at that time have said 'n --- he'.</seg>
<seg id="626">"but," said one of the other black actors. "</seg>
<seg id="627">You only have to hit the hard 'R.'.</seg>
<seg id="628">"and that's exactly where the energy shifts in space, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort."</seg>
<seg id="629">"everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people."</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Rascona says the N-Word, he says it sharp and with reprint."</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>

<seg id="640">"they have experienced Georgias oppressive moisture for almost eight hours, when Brooks carries her on a pilgrimage to the burial places of Malcoms and Dorseys."</seg>
<seg id="641">"until this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels ghostly."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song ring out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body's name."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children squat their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead, mumbles a little boy as if he wanted to remember."</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanked the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>

<seg id="655">"it's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="656">"what this really does with me makes me believe that Lynch is still going on," she added, "today it is called police shooting."</seg>
<seg id="657">"in the same room, Tyrone is holding Brooks's yard at his table, eating and remembering the civil rights."</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he had already started planning the performance next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the post-creation is in a certain way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="865">"and a gate after a kick-off, the Fortunas don't want to catch themselves any more."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more than Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better with the three-chain preparation, than with the four-chain."</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is certain of his cause, "because we just have players in the three chain at half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and we do not achieve so many playthings in the construction."</seg>

<seg id="875">"I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playdays," said Friedhelm Funkel, who didn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season almost with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know exactly where they are at present," says the inner defense of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, guests from the Rhineland are a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) final stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which one has to hit from the start," explains Fortunas boss coach. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some of the refugees who were minor."</seg>

<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person" may be under 18 years old. "</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson, the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said, The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases where the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that" suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older. "</seg>

<seg id="993">"the world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again."</seg>
<seg id="994">"during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, Russian athletics boss, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight doping."</seg>
<seg id="995">"he said," "I'm sorry for" "all the athletes who have won gold and silver medals in competitions."</seg>
<seg id="996">"despite his comments, the IAAF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence on state-sponsored doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer to this day, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="998">The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1094">"on the consumer protection portal www.grocery warnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs batches."</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious champions league tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial fair play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can easily make money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich royal family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may use a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to counteract legitimate income sources that allow them to break even point in their activities related to the football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"former French player believed that clubs which had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini was disgraced by the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the redemption price for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a catarical company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market records, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come over payments of the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar's World Cup ambassador is going to be and a such maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be simply figuring out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to complying with any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not competent to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1159">"over the past few years, Chocolat Frey Board chocolates chocolate for Swiss."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected later to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with less members in this month reluctant to boost growth, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signaled that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to curb the inflation that had been heated by the Brexit and she said that the cost of credit could possibly exceed more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a part of the mammoth economic package published one year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February, even though it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £115 billion."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"according to the Bank's decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households remains subject to consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at interest rates, she repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be needed to cool inflation and a" slightly larger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are currently forecasting the first surge in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the bank stressed that increases would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts revised downwards for this and next year will be 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the Bank forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations on interest rate increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months rose to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will slightly recover after the Bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report showed little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal increase in wages, as the tightening will first get worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that in the coming years monetary policy can not" "prevent the income drop", "but she added that wages will be" "clear" "at the end of their three-year forecasts."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the pound."</seg>
<seg id="1284">"the bank estimates that it will likely take four years, until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rate rose higher, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers asking for an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said this was expected and will be put on again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The bank said that the exceedance in relation to its target of 2% was to be attributed to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Broker, said:" in view of the recent rollout of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive, as the creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mortgages finish, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV preventional treatment after a fight against the High Court in September after a fight against the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-surgery prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study of estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court upheld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England leader Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medicines being taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or as much as two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in hospitals, suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, as used on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in coping with one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive Officer at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, aimed specifically on needy and vulnerable people, offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and terminate the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect persons who are infected with HIV, and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former Bankerin with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the Architecture and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, in order to release the award."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses by Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art came into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counter-important, so that when you push the door high, it is very easily gliding."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have succeeded in enlarging the floor space and at the same time using high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create emotional ties in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of Victorias's largest real estate empire worth over 500 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the family Westco founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 to $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul described as" "Principal operator and the dominating personality" "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means Colin's property has a value of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions suggested by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Colin, such as Paul asserts, has expelled him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the event with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held lawyers."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicatessen in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeanswarehouses of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"he often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark paid $10 million while leaving the company."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were, according to Paul, had become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld himself very much although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin responded by SMS to say "I can't say much" because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to accuse me and draw up our surname through the courts," "he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfil his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," "he said and added that he" "still hope for a solution."</seg>
<seg id="1386">"on Friday, this hope seemed to be over."</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Trump plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporters Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information falling into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame junk by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"at the time, Politico Tara Palmeri wrote that" the key to keeping Trump Twitter habit controlled, according to six former electoral campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that trumps tweets could have even more ignition sources without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may encourage their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to supply desperate information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks and that he stiffens to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy director of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to chicane, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he alleges false accusations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These invariable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said: "they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise comes from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenues by the local tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building offered the County Council as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location, and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Executive Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt facility.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof located in front of the entrance for some time now, and when entering the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations are undertaken."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"floors have been torn down, ceilings partly broken down, old bath tubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is still a lot to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer says."</seg>
<seg id="1466">We want to make a piece of jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and conference room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated inner city level, emphasises shavers."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to set up wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businesspeople should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already talked with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The notions of the city were similar to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"when it comes to investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he expects."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. special investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury upon a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the Board of Directors received the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling on people who were familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper received the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between the former son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller explores if there were agreements between the Trump Contest team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand who acted as advisors of the Republicans during the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took a close look at a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Sonderergenealogist Trump went to the centre and undermine the accusation whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible violations and decide whether to apply charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"for this reason, Grand Jury are also called accusations."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge individuals for interrogation.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to CNN, invitations have been issued that revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"in the report, people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., also Trump counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former electoral campaign leader Paul Manafort took part in the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening in US television, legal experts said that the establishment shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the charging of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good" because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he does not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but I usually work in the secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">"the White House endorses any measures, which accelerated the work of the special investigator in" "fair". ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was called in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this draft, accusations against Trump had become loud; he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey was in front of a Senate Committee in June, Trump asked him for an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations on whether Trump Mueller would be fired.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired upon the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"on Thursday, two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislation that could not be dismissed as easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the west Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg from the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has settled down from the ice shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was confirmed by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the Koloss, weighing over 1 trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for some 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The colossus broken now has been a part of the Larsen-C-horseshoe.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It always grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this ice shelf, the balance of waxes and abort was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are some indications that the Larsen-C horseshoe is in danger, because the front edge has never gone as far back as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks off at a key location."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice cream and icebergs does not elevate the sea level as they float on the water and hold ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice sheet causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth-largest shelf-file of the Antarctic with nearly 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists contested whether the Larsen-C horseshoe would now grow again or fall back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if the researchers did not retrace this gigantic iceberg down to climate change, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and tames it to the areas in which the temperature is the fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1562">"the aim is to meet not only short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should be oriented inwards and externally, show concrete measures for cross-starters and include a training initiative, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good start.</seg>

<seg id="1567">The speech is of a real "competition of the public employer."</seg>

<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Kolb, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he took care of a big surprise already in the working day, when he questioned the number of personnel costs and the other parties baffled."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in co-operation with the surrounding cities - should strive for a house tariff," ""</seg>

<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs, who are involved in search and rescue missions, have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue actions."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly newspaper Ridolce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral ones, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartel, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while the corpses pile up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and its inspiration from Ridolce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney General was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely tried by journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Ridolce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is still more puzzling."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez opened the office of the newspaper Ridolce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot twelve times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"for a minute, forget that there is a state of" peace "when only a cartel controls the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug-trading routes to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Ridolce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to compel Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"in 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Ridolce and sold 50 US dollar holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering any problem of narcotics, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to publish hard examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it carried."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take the task which you as journalist, either that or you are playing the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Ridolce team is missing Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted their routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to best do their job, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret starting and runways, in order to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not lawful," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells bad, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Ridolce Andres Villarreal said that" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen tried shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ridolce in a four-storey building in a central-sized neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the Governor himself described as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce blew three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known fighter Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures which concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter found out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed" El Flaco "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and walked the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Address disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder over the country by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and omitting them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked her to be re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the Media Wächtergruppe" Articulo 19 "has attributed more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in Current Biology described him as" the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur copies of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorser is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clump."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur copies, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and dodge its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it" "Borealopelta Markmitchelli" "to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours of discovering it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur has been hunted by dinosaurs by carnivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"powerful predator behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal for information about his life, including his conserved intestinal contents to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when enormous thermal opods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned in the sea after death and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were resting from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorser was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater cremation kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good that the cutters cover still bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as" rare as a winning in the lotto. "</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18 year old child, and it is still on the street," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed her Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retarded on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed by Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone off in order to return to Tweet via people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police band and people crying, and by a man who claimed to be the father of Browns who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed at which a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman told his rifle and cried," "I'm going to kill you all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," Ferrell recalled at her testimony. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt shivering."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the topic of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a cauliflower and a fitting crown, drove to Ferguson, they discussed a conversation that they had" "over the black experience and the black condition" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she recalled what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," Ferran said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a culmination of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not just activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station when she arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter were associated with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came up with Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan said recently in an interview:" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todebutkt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives followed by the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who talks to us or talks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people will be represented, for this is how I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement" is not about a Messiah leader but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferran said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understand that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have shaped the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions held the movement altogether," Ferry said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" "this is not an affirmatical type of action", "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film as a result of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands so much in the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV viewers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but since the first presentation of 2009, the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic rarely leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one says to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real "(Nicole Schauste), comes from the other side:" no man "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, of which the rest of the shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery will be exactly planned on the plot, on which the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketing products offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the farmers market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes made by the rural women always very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities this is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this should not be very low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping mall in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are plenty of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market there, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, as the tenants there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of them will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the farmers market hall be built during construction time?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghosts bit gallery already manage to distribute all the business from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and no one needs a shopping center, which is empty."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view it would have been better to promote a real peasant market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market there is no place in Bitburg thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"many faces can be seen in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfner and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after revealing a secret diplomat about WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and a trailblazing dissident whose conviction was changed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary, not only to the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits comfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with whom she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg emerged from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she could not be photographed at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse were turned into unequal glasses, which changed several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Supplement Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would be converted to Overseas Judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"indeed, that Obama was indeed just a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand was a welcome type of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is conducting a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways in order to further inflame the rigid divisions he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to" automatic fragmentation, "whose foundation is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As. written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological regards, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with us is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows maning, as it appears with a hands-free spying gun in the hands of the disciplinary collections of the United States like King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech cold, then they have won," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greeted her from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacles, which unite like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford were sought for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunting is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are looked for as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died 26, after several engravings."</seg>
<seg id="2162">"a common warning system, published by the Chicago Police Authority, states that the body was discovered on July 27."</seg>

<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead in the place of action, and detectives examine the stitches as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president of university relations, said in an e-mail explaining that Lathemum had now been in scrutiny and excluded from entering the University of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he strongly urge the suspects to submit to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of her whereabouts, and our efforts to locate her reinforce", "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza building who had just gotten a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that both lay and warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>

<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA driving plan in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows, however, that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the examination approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly funded doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"mutko said in terms of the matter:" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has gotten a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian outlet rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has tried to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was expelled from the WADA as part of the Doping scandal of the WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources start-ups is waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to perform surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups to provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.

<seg id="2213">"in addition to the snap-surveys and surveys done by certain teams, it offers a heat chart of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consents results - so that you can rebove why."</seg>

<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school, for the first time during Moras, six playing times were practised in Westwood practical exercises."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Atl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshire one with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "he says melancholy."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Handiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. "</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>

<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting a little") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena-pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape plasters, gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey, "and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let everything go his way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an upheaval that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are connected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit child that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"the Smuggler, in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney:" "lords seemed to be a crook, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men solved their school crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlords."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his enrolment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel on Eläkermäki, the area of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who Erdogan as a wire puller of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"for 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara is negotiating for this week in Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated a coup attempt as a" divine gift, "as he gave him the opportunity to" completely clean the armed forces. ""</seg>

<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the paper" Hürriyet "published an article titled" Unhairy in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing" Islamisation "of the army, which among other things manifests itself in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the large-scale teaching in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in the middle of July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 starters, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as though Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted on their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform regulations of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more alarming as many robots have the "personalities" that would look progressive a stepford-woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyling."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed to conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, if one goes one step on Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, troublefree one."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on its website, True Companion Roxxxy has a vibrator but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a Roxxxy?" "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just simply another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not keep any sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is crossed out of the boundary zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women are worldwide threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most frightening aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid 'Tale' ('The Report of the maid') are not the graphic pictures, the devoured body and the out-sighted eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornopop proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate or simply walk away from your companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no intermediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maids</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican kinship with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same page."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but in a further context it seems to me that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the Left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we talk of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the spooky way that one day his kittens will not be repulsed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing" normalize "that suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's Futurgical Version of the Crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans has to be spiritually healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2492">Do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"in the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"they should improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5, and some Euro 6."</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanine from the ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new promotion mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No. the software updates that are traded are voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have become the Schuman Software," says Anja Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">"the manufacturers announced swift implementation in the coming months, but not yet known as an exact date."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler advised to address any affected person.</seg>
<seg id="2505">"if an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within its framework."</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the changeovers take place altogether?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," says Smetanin. "</seg>
<seg id="2508">It depends on the manufacturer's commitment as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, the automakers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update take?</seg>
<seg id="2511">Retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">It could be time-consuming to get an appointment.</seg>

<seg id="2527">The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">"traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and join together with his wife Melania at the award ceremony."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"the award winner Lear, announced with progressive TV series, has already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala."</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire in retirement in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place is already written out, but suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker is a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun for him as he mediates during the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">"at the earliest possible date, the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer."</seg>
<seg id="2542">"according to the regular periods of notice, this should still be enough time for a familiarization."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts as a sub-law office for the Administrative Community, the applicant must submit appropriate conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they could no longer be able to fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in ministry, some significant projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is sure of the Bauamt and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla Areas and the Niederhofen parkwill have been encountered."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the zigzag bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium refurbishment is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will be charged with around €1.5 million," if we do it right, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is great leeway for a city builder."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslachs's own farm yard and landscaping, it can be reacted quite flexibly on a variety of occasions."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors."</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the oldtown as an ensemble stands under monument protection, it is important to have an eye for what" fits "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the city builder is responsible for a high level of responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a client," in the end everything runs here over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"in the case of care and coordination, he can count on many years of co-operation: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes:" "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if anyone wants to bury Roland Wacker, according to the town of Haslach, a completed degree course should be presented as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway slide crossing in the area of the Leoben Street (B116) on the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be halted.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators depart from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"close to the crime scene, a rose and a bike rider had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond the region of Lausanne," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">"the perpetrator, or the perpetrator, would have brought himself into great danger and also endangers the traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and equipment, as well as the delay of the delay and the costs for rail transport, even patrons of the railway customers could be transferred to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, a" "substantial sum" "said the speaker."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern track could be run without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"nearly ten people were on Friday morning, two of them concerned the long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not come out, but they were late."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study suggests just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"it suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourages a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigates a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separate, this did not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiases of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacteria species found in mice with immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were retracted in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they got the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria impacted on the immune system, researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells, which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. Cruteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."</seg>

<seg id="2606">"the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup kicked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper's role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira."</seg>
<seg id="2607">"matic, however, had been excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes what Mourinho admits he had to improve before the beginning of the premier league season."</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said. "</seg>
<seg id="2609">We will help him to be ready sooner than later.</seg>
<seg id="2610">"besides Matic, Victor Lindel of and Romelu Lukaku started in the aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season."</seg>
<seg id="2611">"the Independent contained in this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a" fantastic job, "three of its four priority new commitments."</seg>
<seg id="2612">"three out of four, I thank the association for that," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2613">"I will be happier if they get four of four for me, but they have made great effort."</seg>

<seg id="2615">The aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">"the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometres."</seg>

<seg id="2622">"Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem"</seg>
<seg id="2623">"as the wind turns, when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD chief, S & D Prime Minister glanced at elections with a certain concern for Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"only there was no fire from the party headquarters, but no headwind from the Confederation - that was the most important wish of the electors."</seg>
<seg id="2625">"since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"since then, the employees of Willy-Brandt-Haus have been observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals."</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with headwind.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were gravings.</seg>
<seg id="2629">One after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against the coalitions of the SPD and the Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once again: red-green can simply not be reliably governed," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprise group-president of a Green MP has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"five months before the parliamentary elections, its red-green coalition with it lost its one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP."</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green Federal Executive Officer Michael Kellner called on the apostate Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Tweir to give her mandate back.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transfer to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tire must immediately return her mandate," "said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Green Party editorial network (RND)."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"this must not be true at all," "an SPD election militant sighed, when the new press message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU without his own government majority following the departure of the Green MP Elke Tweir."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what's next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miser started with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">"a blue eye, more not, the comrades were calming at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2643">"after the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different."</seg>
<seg id="2644">That's what it became - and everything became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the cavern, the Düsseldorf-Pleite hauled the party smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the weeks after that the comrades worked tiously.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"then, when they had just had new courage, the G-20 summit was reached from Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him the next deep beat came.</seg>
<seg id="2649">"mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD president of the SPD, lost his Nimbus at that weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning."</seg>
<seg id="2650">"and because in crisis communication, he did not do anything wrong, which can be done wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2651">Scholz has been fighting for his political survival ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"because of the VW-exhaust-type and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister has long been under criticism."</seg>
<seg id="2654">The survey results were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"still, or maybe because of this, Weil was trying to set accents in the federal government in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="2656">"the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz's surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him a stabilisation of the party by Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">"in doing so, Weil is not responsible for the party-internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Greens."</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz no longer at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"for the time being, comrades endeavour to keep their own ranks closed."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"their anger is directed towards the Greens, and here especially to the apostate parliamentarian Tests."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratic as Mrs. Twesten combined her own career prospects over the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network (RND). "</seg>
<seg id="2664">"Mrs. Tweir hasn't been elected a direct candidate because of her personality, but on the regional list of the Lower Saxony Greens in the Parliament, such as the Lower Saxony parliament."</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains of an" undemocratic maneuver. ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voters' willingness four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil a prime minister," "said Oppermann, who led the Lower Saxony SPD to the Bundestag election, the RND."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"now the personal career of a future CDU deforts the election result," "said Oppermann."</seg>

<seg id="2676">"back then, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous restructuring is a" success project "- it is ultimately important to promote internal development as well and not only to develop new building areas."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, I received the information from the government presidium Karlsruhe that there will be a redevelopment area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount amounted to 833 333 Euro, of which 500,000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the community."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is the area of rehabilitation?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will continue to investigate, so Schindler, where the" really old "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"however, it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area whatsoever, to refurbish."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the regional boundaries could then also be moved again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the stamp represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the content of the" "Social City" "federal government programme, in which the restructuring would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"core of the program is revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be object-related, that is, per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">"the licensing period for the funding has been running since January 1, 2017 to April 30, 2026."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the inventory will be carried out only once, in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area, a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the statute should be made as far as possible, so that in the coming year it can be started with the renovations."</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that every commune had to carry out the abovementioned preventive examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the aim is to evaluate and determine the urbanistic grievances, when it is rehabilitated and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective property, there will be a letter in the land register as well."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will come again after sensations and get a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gottscheber stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and property sheet", "in which it deals with the structural condition and the renovation views."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the grey questionnaire, the" household and housing arch, "information on size, layout and residents of a living room can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "arc" "is to be filled only when operating in the building business premises."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, it must be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new building measures are not eligible for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler stresses that the distribution of funds in accordance with the" "greyhound principle" "- who comes first, first grinds."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"you can't make funds for later." ""</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event produced by American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $24,000 in accordance with the military provided to the TIME Magazine."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all over 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed next to a yacht of Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy marine commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message indicates that on July 17th, the helicopter arrived at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal workers to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could harm the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," answered the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president announced a push for reform of health reform underway in the Senate and propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to demand their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February Trump took an inspection in February when the presidential jet delivered before the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the president's plane through its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made in America "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to deal with the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for" "Made in America" "event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours on that day for non-presidential missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">"the White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props, which were presented at the event."</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budgeted awards for the presidential charter, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former White House press spokesperson, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week that are made in America," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to highlight this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and was joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann believes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication in front of the German press agency, as expected by former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own omissions or their false appraisal of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised the fact that in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen," two standards "were measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful deeds "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future, but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of naming the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also commented:" one likes to go to the church and this is a feeble fresher. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, she pointed out that" "punches were a very normal pedagogical tool," "in order to cope with naughty children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they find it unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, for the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger, wrote the mementbook" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Ezekiel, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report commissioned by the Bishum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 domes sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that by many cases Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hannemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal caused by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violence Exercise on Protected Fools at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, it also appears as choline and perfectionist, which became handy when a cathedral-sparrow did not bring top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is there at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"there are eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him, learn from it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by almost all the respondents as - literally -" Redemption, "" Heaven "and" Better World. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provides an excellent testimony," sincere, "" sincere, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "and" always sourced from grapes from children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only pop with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also distributed ear-files and drew too cheeky boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the period of time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know these methods of cultivation?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us, who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually deals with in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are of course Bagatellen."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not with his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media were just falling on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still eager to work."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the media reported a lot about misuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger is also accused of any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assault alleges to have familiarised themselves with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of those people," "It was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who, to a certain extent, had been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you assess Ratzinger's Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in the context of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it has been calculated... Buben getting more intrusive and clearer, or rather open compared to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">The report concludes with a clear result: "that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to talk about any involvement."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link up his good name with these abovementioned crimes, as happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was much of" "violence excesses" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up became a huge plier of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let's say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report treats incidents of the time since 1945, including four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the child of sadistic teachers were almost victimized and tortured, all of them acquired at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the cathedral gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the subject" "pre-school" "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the reproach remains to have been stolen away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently give ear to the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral splitter grammar school, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that, in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties in Bavaria had long been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he would have always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the punishment of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, and not for what was banned in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"that's all awful, and I'm glad that it's finally being processed."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. ear figs and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was banned, he was strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "Mein Brother der Papst" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of DUT fine also contribute to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the cathedral-cats only played a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not know at all that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world transposition, true culture ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and sweets on your own, the unruly boys don't even make a great singer and before every success, regardless of the area, but still discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experience again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-good person, from which one can not imagine that he could also do something in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly see how many former Domspas today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep contact with him, visit him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the Domspatzen is grateful to him for having enriched their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respect person, to whom they still look up and honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all you submit to it are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intent behind it is only too apparent.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the state would command, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
