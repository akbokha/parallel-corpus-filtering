28 @-@ year old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother testified that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , and shared the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigation was underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston , had spent six months his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him finally . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; stated Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; to combine his way with his family was to bring us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the announcement of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston needs not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vocal in an interview .
I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside label that usually have little to do with me and reality .
I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , pre@@ m TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; on the white draft , she asks the question of a child &apos;s wish : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they ch@@ ased home to feed the feed in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and with it the riding career ended again .
on Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
&quot; he had his family run over the anne@@ x of the AL@@ RV , he sw@@ ung to a horse not even for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , the first time was in Aachen and there@@ with also at the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Mi@@ xed Py@@ ramid .
the li@@ ke@@ able sports@@ man does not lack awards .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the Sport pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans GÃ¼nter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporty successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ winner was shot at the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the distinguished members include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder , Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ eh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports le@@ agues came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the lau@@ rel price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Econom@@ ists Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep them small and warn about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , alle@@ gations Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ strain regulation , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open disadvantages to dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes would increase for the rich , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in order to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost silent . &quot;
the democratic candidate termin@@ ates the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there could be party @-@ internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and to drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement aims to termin@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; with their investment programme , Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly expand the renewable energies and demand : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign the two . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , however , both don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better , for example , Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : one time he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ att@@ led , then he says he can &apos;t be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months will probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , is about to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics argue , that the budget deficit would only increase . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every escaped wife has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby who is at the most a year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he glan@@ ced curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and , among other things , deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ minded women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs launched the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid Association . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman arriving here has experience with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; B@@ ahr recalls . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten torture or death , or because their families will send them to Europe as a hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this continues . &quot;
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and at worst mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this results in the fact that about 90 per cent of women resi@@ ding in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they estimate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed . &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they dare not speak openly about what we experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; because they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations just need for them , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project as in Munich , some of them answer no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accomod@@ ations of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stor@@ eys or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; committee also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the washing rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women , is included in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection , one can read at the rush that there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; having talked about that there is , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make up a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new labor campaign measures
assistants of the assistants have called upon their union to approve new work campaign measures in their disputes relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council to approve more work campaig@@ ning from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC announced that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; per@@ sever@@ ing calm &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and demand official new negotiations for all your worries . &quot;
&quot; in response to the government &apos;s silence , the President of the J@@ DC has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work of action that begins in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that , six times , assistance specialists strike the first total failure in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A assistance specialists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place prior to the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , with the conclusion that the contract was to be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite player in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s s@@ miles seemed sli@@ pper@@ y , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a paper describing that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if it had never happened . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state did not forget anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was wild@@ ly burning .
Putin denoun@@ ced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
&quot; the decline was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
re@@ building the c@@ ousin will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a fierce , un@@ restricted attack against Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the most serious were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his office last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demographic put it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara to demand support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to Russia and Turkey : two countries , who were viol@@ ated and treated badly by the West , and now joined together . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter , it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for Scotland clients no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Win@@ ner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the exchange listing to Nat@@ west are to be changed . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for retail banking that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he announced the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the Bank of the brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bench for customers ? &quot; said the board of directors . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori bo@@ asted champagne for a double at the New@@ market , bringing 3@@ 000@@ th profit to him &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British winning at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ au , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori sums up the jubil@@ ation when he brings victory to Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career points &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he achieved this milestone which only few have achieved before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma has been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6.000 profits , if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years of winner , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; Flying Fin@@ ishes on Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ ory Si@@ eben &quot; in As@@ cot , 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six months lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he has not been at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least five years of age .
Russian Putin Hum@@ ans Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly released his head of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been the deputy of Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , has been appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that later he was a log boss and staff leader of the government personnel .
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin , &quot; Th@@ ank you for your trust . &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state in relation to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
&quot; on Friday , Putin announced that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ a@@ ino as his successor . &quot;
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has intri@@ c@@ ately intri@@ cate Moscow .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile on the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy once - met with great skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said . &quot; it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining items for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V participated in the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin was a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another ally approached ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin was Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ Kir@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on the set , there were artistic differences and differences of opinion . &quot;
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios &apos; comments . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood into it for the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot;
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28th .
puzzles to land fish in garden in Ban@@ ff
a citizen of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin Ba@@ in thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sand @-@ whales pe@@ pper@@ ed by a fountain .
&quot; Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope , hoping that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the Â£ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical cables . &quot;
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last part of the deck receives a ju@@ g@@ gling for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter is the trend@@ setting high and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower in the extension , we had to close the existing gap on the north or side of the land . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approximately 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , they were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck &quot; to be alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off an@@ gler &apos;s fishing boat from fishing boats . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved out of their own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at age 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the shore rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men , who were thrown into the water , have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man goes to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked her ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic offen@@ ders cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 year old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothing , he called his mother . &quot;
the latter then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to so@@ ot@@ he her brother . &quot;
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the road , they met the ex @-@ wife of the man . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who will build cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : investors should in future be taken much more strongly into the duty .
how do you respond to the bad news that in the next few years Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 inexpensive apartments ?
&quot; the SPD , for the next council session , proposes a &quot; living concept for action . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments actually ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , however , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of housing as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann , &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prescri@@ p@@ tions as possible .
the left wants more har@@ dy conditions for investors .
&quot; despite this , according to Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation is on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do we compensate for the loss of other around 1300 inexpensive apartments whose support will continue in the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased on @-@ going bin@@ dings from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one blow the problem could be solved .
because in the western city there are dead@@ lines at the end of the year .
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : this does not mean the owners and the housing associations .
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of soci@@ alists in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will be even more movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise .
&quot; Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time in star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; I am referring to the Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later arose a series of animations , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been shifted by massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ Ã©@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and as soon as they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ff , an Apple Watch app that followed 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who exercise 30 minutes each day , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health who want to bring people &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; stum@@ bled on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
&quot; exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the Wonder@@ ful thing about Pok@@ Ã©@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ oo@@ ky game @-@ per@@ ils , which always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk around a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
a breakthrough occurred .
&quot; even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time .
&quot; thanks to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the asset in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast opened the competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ sts Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ net@@ h on the Swedish bar during the individual campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated her sport the last three years , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign of women during the Winter Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the retired Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - containing their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition any more , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was easily led by two turns , the picture ble@@ w . &quot;
balance beams and ground @-@ ages - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - was l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the bri@@ m beam , and placed one on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly when she expected her du@@ oden@@ um - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into fine red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their down@@ fall , they threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ eba to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass murder during listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a weapon of his hand , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether or not she is associated with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was put on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder , and it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his age , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband , Vincent and her , has been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l until his third year of life and he can &apos;t speak yet .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has thought of &quot; Please sing something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs on her own .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected virus infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me someone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency booth on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in extreme rain , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service said that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ites close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ in near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability be reached over the weekend record levels . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mo@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi National border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still associated people from floo@@ ding in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek &apos;s water , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water streaming and streaming in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said to Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a flood of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Emer@@ gency Hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were housed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the floo@@ ding was &quot; &quot; spreading rapidly &quot; , &quot; as there was still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer posted near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the soil was considerably su@@ cked by the ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts .
&quot; the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ L , reported that a subordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa gave 200 flooded houses . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the community Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ in and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated people . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to flood water and sand@@ bags provided for the residents to take part , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy des Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday will have been reported as flooded , but no reports have been reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years now . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police informs that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at the hospital with his transport . &quot;
&quot; he went through a lot , his little body was dren@@ ched with bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores told the station . &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether or not one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators divided C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several gun@@ men .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ lap the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were found . &quot;
&quot; so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di , the police station in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently re@@ viewing reports of the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squee@@ ze on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ covers , and the police are still searching for a suspect . &quot;
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and this for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three female gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympi@@ ad of the Olympic and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ly gym@@ n@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual campaig@@ ning event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns are a more expensive sport and that Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private gymnas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents responsible for training , training , travel appar@@ el , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their Tur@@ ner and Famili@@ es ) . &quot;
the majority of these gymnas@@ tics are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the congregations out innum@@ erable young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym . &quot;
I founded my 20 @-@ year foundation .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistants want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistants who voted in favour of a election declined . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and would be harmful any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistants should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend packages to improve the maintenance to ast@@ ral times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors said last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistants have serious concerns on the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat the current mat@@ ernity crisis and treat it to all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks met with the government on reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes ear @-@ num@@ bing silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise awareness and address the concerns of assistants .
&quot; if he did not do this , the assistant doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaign measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 meetings as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the pi@@ cket line . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to have a better week pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; competition measures achieve nothing that only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing staff and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; over the past two months , we talked to the Committee of Assist@@ ants and spoke positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries in response to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important subjects - such as des@@ patch , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health concerning adher@@ ence to the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .

the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
&quot; when the floor@@ covering falls apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are likely to have another risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;

&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness will thri@@ ve electoral fraud in Muslim areas &quot; &quot; &quot;
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office last year
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les addresses the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Government , who is now an ant@@ oni@@ alist , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of elec@@ tive bo@@ oths in order to protect frigh@@ tened voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should have a badge to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at the moment , a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , when they submit their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election scandal in the East of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was supposed to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cal &quot; and that he had silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic alle@@ gations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him .
up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading ID cards to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; evidence has been made to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there have been concerns that ... State institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letters of letters to stop &quot; &quot; electoral harv@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immig@@ rant and social security purposes . &quot;
consider choosing voters before choosing your ID .
use not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has submitted her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic letter code .
prohibition of political activists to process full postal sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of letters of mail .
the police have the authority to set up barriers for electoral stations .
a change in legislation facilit@@ ated by an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation according to the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( People &apos;s Docum@@ ents Act 1983 ) .
ban on photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement for only English to be used in election stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go into the electoral cabin alone . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint was placed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his substitute for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check @-@ out controls &quot; of the City Hall &apos;s election regi@@ strations .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of line with the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only athlete competing in gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces gle@@ aming at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates &apos;s double @-@ runner on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US crew in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street star look like un@@ cann@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity except facial hair , &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British dancer Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one way higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor .
&quot; another prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; put theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming pool .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , departed like mad , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; the Chinese flo@@ ats in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ is from China described in the final 4 x 200m Free @-@ style swimming @-@ pool for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the Cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard .
Twitter users did not stick back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let all of us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ don@@ ald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming performance was broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of over 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ ald via Twitter

C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .

&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said is very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald informed himself in the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of the float , not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mark to try bot@@ toms . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the situation worse , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled it off and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without purchasing anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the show@@ room , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own stock@@ ings and trousers and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat discreet location to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the pants , which you obviously did not like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three other pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , attracted again and went out . &quot;
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting it is to think that someone would take home under@@ pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn &apos;t get washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .@@ com. &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when approaching from behind you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; get out of the shot , &quot; Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi says . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ e@@ arm and shoulder before hitting your face with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat it with your knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the attack@@ er cur@@ bs from pain , the weapon comes out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the gun out of its handle before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y , it &apos;s best to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
traveler Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler pulled off his immune system and sau@@ sage ef@@ lex of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; present@@ er and tour author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ ab@@ te his course on a Euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before completing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to take . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the idea of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a ten@@ si@@ le toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he was le@@ aking , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public money at stations to flus@@ hing out of toilets , the task assigned its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said , &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to live up to his reputation in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the guide film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in various places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes close to the worst I have ger@@ o@@ ed in a toilet . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ o Senior &apos;s President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming by saying &quot; Let &apos;s Ian call us . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had checked out some of the things I instructed him to lick , like the ec@@ el@@ ly Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ soci@@ etal family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ ci@@ al family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ stration with a damage of Â£ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls had g@@ aping holes , wood plan@@ ks were rou@@ gh@@ ed , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , working for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror which the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old garbage has been found &quot;
&quot; in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were rou@@ gh@@ ed &quot;
&quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and had to be inv@@ oked regularly by the police . &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing moved her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended term of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one of them said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now that they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had agreed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
on the high @-@ level side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step taken into account Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived in the house at different times , but they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ging on the floor . &quot;
workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis and scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of Â£ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine after having become guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial law .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house walls were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they are occup@@ ying tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row from the Police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall announced that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
pan@@ i@@ cking tourists in Portugal after a ti@@ eff@@ lor@@ ous military jet flies over the beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers at Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ gal P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft flew an incredible storm flight
&quot; the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but persi@@ sted in the fact that there was no safety risk &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ ected jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew nearly within reach of the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the tourists jumped up , understand@@ ably , to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came on them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers posting videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me .
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces persi@@ sted on the fact that security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; space fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people also died on Madeira Island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ strikes today stated that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which restric@@ ts his sight &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step to win the first title in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in Du@@ el for the Spanish Super@@ cup out against FC Sevilla , the return game is three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ sp@@ inner must renoun@@ ce to N@@ ey@@ mar , an Olympic football tournament with the under@@ signed Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europe league champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing . &quot;
&quot; in the training , the German suffered a b@@ anded st@@ ump in the knee , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision in this regard and left Bra@@ vo in the league but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other candidates took the lead .
&quot; before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish champion doubts about the fitness level of the team who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; even at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced yet . &quot;
&quot; Sev@@ ille , again , has the 2 : 3 defeat following extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in a separate league table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the World Ranking List won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it into the final game as expected and made themselves the title of each other .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese might pick up the single title in the mark of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the top olymp@@ ic bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ã @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs they didn &apos;t have coaches with them . &quot;
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ actors in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; the matches until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said succ@@ inc@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ il@@ ateral un@@ il@@ ateral .
&quot; with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ versary , Ma had to fight only in the first movement . &quot;
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; due to the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match did not develop . &quot;
but nevertheless sufficient breath @-@ taking ball changes could be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had pulled a rib@@ bed injury and had to be content with sheet metal afterwards . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump grants â³ mighty problems â³ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now revealed weaknesses of his campaign campaign in the previous Repub@@ lican strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi @-@ million@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents said . &quot;
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own Repub@@ lican camp , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; Tr@@ ump said before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; due to false reports of his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
tor@@ ches repub@@ lican strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance that is common for repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview with the broad@@ caster CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
&quot; and afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , then it was ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to withdraw funds to support his campaign , he should not be able to present better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans wanted to take stronger arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : three @-@ day sc@@ am with dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee , with immediate effect , informed a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this has been reported by the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case to ex@@ ert its own investigations and announced an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; she said in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed over the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as &apos;s head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich became World Cup fourth in Beijing over 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya has been under special surveillance at the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing delays for some time now .
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was unusual pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic commen@@ cement .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Championship in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a substantial mentality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar study in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it has been proven that this sport has been systematically dup@@ lic@@ ated and systematically dup@@ lic@@ ated . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; Salzburg conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth space with the role of Mary .
&quot; orchest@@ ral works by Sim@@ Ã³n Bol@@ Ã­@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Con@@ duc@@ tor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix and the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins Musik in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she reminds herself of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she is wise , of course also na@@ Ã¯@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as RÃ¶@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a mon@@ strous human being .
and Bart@@ oli back the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece , there are prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ als went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and today they are as meaningful as they were then . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , according to reports , died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had left to leave the war @-@ torn country and returned to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the East of London rose in a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and became a widow within a few months . &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of an election victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s presidential candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation from his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d announced during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants to have N@@ eck Calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co @-@ operates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked human beings , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine distinguishes from Old@@ school Play@@ boys , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
he apparently believes that the calendar is also doing so .
&quot; we have to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing appeal in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ close foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees escap@@ ing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; following the harsh blow of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime further comb@@ ats minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ acted months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the sec@@ t@@ arian coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they are re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the head of associations compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure of travel to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been exter@@ min@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the head of the Association demanded that the German government &quot; &quot; positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the GÃ¼@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as GÃ¼@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t care and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and SÃ¤@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the GÃ¼@@ len @-@ close foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs , the Turks set the largest group of asylum @-@ seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as the right to obtain asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey we do not find the pre @-@ war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state @-@ side , individual follow @-@ up . &quot;

strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania they understood .
&quot; until 2021 , the state election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid as yet , it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced of the election milit@@ ants are on holiday .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ Ã¼gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the land tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate the ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count at the end of counting , just rub@@ bing lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign in close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s . &quot;
what is exciting is how strong new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign , one sees from his large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spreads roses and ch@@ ats a bit with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Se@@ ering got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel is bl@@ aming the Af@@ D &apos;s thri@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; We create it &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make electoral campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s federal election circle is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not right , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign bo@@ oths on market places and in front of shopping centers with suns@@ ha@@ des and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that in the country , the base is crum@@ bling , that it has to strain itself very hard to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is self @-@ expos@@ ing , however : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in the poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats recently backed by 22 percent of partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had yet clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Green Party , with seven percent in the poll@@ s , is likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holiday , and mostly move their election campaign into the internet . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; is the name of the regional president , Claudia MÃ¼ller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tors go on a trail search for local voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the leading candidate , cur@@ vy straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and end only at 8 p.m. , there are everywhere praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the reci@@ proc@@ ity of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of occup@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the frozen section of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg was resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the village was relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now continue on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the ev@@ asive passage through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; said the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the restoration of the rehabilitation department . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ bru@@ k , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straÃe , Haf@@ ner@@ straÃe and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many ble@@ aching paths were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were hiding in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality demanded more of the show vehicle from M@@ Ã¶s@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable exagger@@ ations , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed on the spot himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have already been inj@@ ected .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to break@@ through@@ s among them , everyone you ask is scrut@@ ini@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; the running documents are missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited is the local bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants took it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we need to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; as a result , the sales revenues are &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to leave half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , the president JÃ¶rg Schmidt announced on a request by G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where such a more generous is handled . &quot;
&quot; with all suits , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t travel , it &apos;s also somewhere else . &quot;
G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner has no doubts that his stem cell comes back to the end of the renovation work .
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ Ã¶h@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
it is constantly being scre@@ wed down in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
other out@@ going points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; real@@ is@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for safety in the republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority will take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger passenger data and weapons law . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies does not come as a surprise .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is starting a second trial for proposals that had not yet to be done with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadi@@ sts with double nationality at the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he thinks it reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by De Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re as well .
some of them are in themselves : he is planning quick procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more opportunities for the detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are specifically fet@@ ched into the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of Dul@@ ventions for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse still worse than so far - such as com@@ mitting crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to obsc@@ ure their identity . &quot;
some of these are politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
some of them are un@@ exploited and leave questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees . &quot;
and things that have pro@@ found@@ ly employed people let themselves not be cl@@ inging out even in election times .
the inner security has moved enormously into the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; over the past few days , between the two parties it was high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , where the resort leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship . &quot;
&quot; even here , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re ar@@ ves around irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to re@@ open , do not make sense . &quot;
and he has constitutional obj@@ ections in case of a Bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must still be shown . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could take care of stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently attempting to profit from the issue of internal security .
&quot; at first , the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen does not yet arrive g@@ lim@@ pf@@ ish .
&quot; in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the number of deliveries increases worldwide . &quot;
but it &apos;s not going anywhere in all markets .
&quot; during the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen inv@@ ests in the second half of the year when it comes to deliveries .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer continues to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening above all in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the total sales as announced by the Da@@ x company . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold more than 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; JÃ¼rgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of sales , led the weaker figures from July , above all to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy a purchase in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the EU &apos;s exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ atmosphere escal@@ ated first , a minus is also available . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is further g@@ lim@@ ely due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a distribution minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Chief Executive Officer Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales platform . &quot;
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with software exhaust gas tests .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; according to the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer has issued a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in company circles . &quot;
reason to be j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal refin@@ ement .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee for equipped diesel models .
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW &apos;s representative in the Federal Transport Ministry . &quot;
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these will not be accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , there will be no deterioration in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; for example , with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in customer interest , too , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the scandal , comes to an in@@ security with regard to possible warranty regulations , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , in the future , demands pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; chief Executive Officer Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; would not have to fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks spend money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay a penalty of 0.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; as of September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund demands this fee from private and corporate clients for deposits over â¬ 100,000 on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he paid 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause costs of 0.4 percent , &quot; said the chief of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now continuing . &quot;
&quot; just leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; the bank Chief said . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the association of co @-@ operatives declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear it alone , be &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits covering deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a bank@@ sman said at the Lake of T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; there is a clientele that is a little more luxuri@@ ant from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if she is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative bank G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; at present no other banks are known to the co @-@ operatives association &quot; Bayern &quot; that charge a compensation for deposits received by private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ Ã¶h@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the neg@@ atives vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is fierce and the emig@@ ration of investors to competition is imminent .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like this in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comments section , to convi@@ ct him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ all@@ ele male middle aged with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a plate are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older record buyers usually retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and ro@@ de wild , before I stop , hold my hands and say something special : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly making its way to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand close to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , I am of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared , and buy items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records tend to be intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets to apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and forced to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom in tra@@ ilers of a specific age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took off@@ ence on the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , of objects that ev@@ oke happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or ow@@ ning material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people . &quot;
it &apos;s a simple way to engage mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a plate stack . &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the news report , I would probably look very worried , while stro@@ lling through a stack of bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Rooms : three men of middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone only recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it will definitely happen . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ like , less music @-@ like . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player .
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has an entertaining audience than I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age girls and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts offers the latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ t@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks odd , but na@@ iling mental trauma is hard to det@@ ach when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of records standing for sale . &quot;
she &apos;s more of a window @-@ stroll than a big shopping .
&quot; she does not deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives away with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the impression to bra@@ ise the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a stair@@ way , a wall full of panels of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they are ignored , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bees on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing gaze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders of no men of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer concerning demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where people sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court with the fact that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who had the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois M@@ oll@@ a said that the food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely eating people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; CafÃ© of the Camp , which is operated by the community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; cafÃ© . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; for these children a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the Olympic time , cycl@@ ist Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get enter@@ tained . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he has no explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; to me , honestly , it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s passage , &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot;
he must analyse in silence what reasons led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time of the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin really wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are to effectively transfer speed lighter . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istically looking En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident spots where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary tem@@ pl@@ ating there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flash for adher@@ ence to speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement operations ; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be tra@@ cked across multiple lanes simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as access prohibited by time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ performance condition , it is possible to move the trailer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear bul@@ let @-@ proof outer cover . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain retri@@ eves silver in the 7 @-@ franc ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji presented a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line @-@ running and raw power to win gold - her first medal of the Olympic med@@ als of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; but , regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in top form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderfully and ra@@ ined the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun .
&quot; it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co . on as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au crossed in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB didn &apos;t touch the ball .
&quot; a prev@@ entative torch of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the Berg of Man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute runner j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a there was a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new beginning , and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB has still been taught . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB resulted in basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova as a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , F@@ ahnen wa@@ ved and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB kno@@ cked out cr@@ ushing into the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier this day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als of 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than in these games and that wants what .
&quot; from the first rowing stroke to the last , 220 harsh H@@ ieve who go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all there when they row@@ ed to the second Olympics in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , who set such a standard . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ 000 un@@ speak@@ able commitment , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers that make up the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and no one was an assistant of the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the Trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge but that makes it even bigger .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a vac@@ uous morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; This week I was an emotional wre@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I have done , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something good .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adventure Steve Bak@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , will reti@@ re . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exemplary .
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was a matter of time ago in the original on a part of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia stran@@ gled the purpose association .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller , who was 31 years old in the &quot; &quot; Zw@@ eck@@ verband &quot; &quot; employee , stands for 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein water @-@ purpose association with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water each year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Broad@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d BÃ¼h@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller was appointed as a water@@ ist in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and fees to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a stand@@ still , and I have always added innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food@@ stuff . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised GÃ¶@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has invested with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has lived through the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was able to present the successful concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group on the reduction of nit@@ rate in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s water@@ forum . &quot;
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ eller , on his part , praised the Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best wat@@ ert@@ keeper and he was a loyal scar@@ f .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼r@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ Ã¶ller .

Rel@@ ation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man shoots at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man was shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his wife , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I am openly punished . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald head . &quot;
meanwhile the police released a photo of him .
&quot; it is , however , a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship at work . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the do@@ er in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in LÃ¼@@ beck didn &apos;t want to provide information about the di@@ version or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing delic@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; we are not saying any more at this time , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in LÃ¼@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition from the existing plants for so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ary Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is tra@@ cked . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity generation .
this will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel is Future , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emission legislation , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO JÃ¶rg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation grew worse when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw large @-@ scale steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on imported steel have an impact on imported steel . on the other hand , economic prospects have risen in China . &quot;
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have been stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally did not want to exclude closures of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced amount went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching of the teacher she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular gather@@ ings , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly demand their lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ff quickly in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening to songs awak@@ ens memories of elderly people , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia are sin@@ king to long @-@ standing events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for something long , I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
so there are enough reasons to start singing .
&quot; whoever wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have various options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings out of the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a senior choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the Internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react more sensitive than boys on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover what effect the calls of cat &apos;s babies have on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved alike in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who think in great need , as scientists found out by the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
han@@ go@@ vers are also responding to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ am differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; they were scre@@ ened to a herd of babies , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet their own offspring , re@@ acted differentiated to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they swi@@ vel more quickly to the speaker when this cry of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was playing .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noise . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensitive to infants , no matter whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacked with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ me@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the arch of the arch @-@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already in the suspension of the state of emergency after the overthrow of the revolution in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
this is also not the case before football .
the At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office issued an arrest warrant against the former strong opponent Hak@@ an SÃ¼@@ ver .
&quot; in the meantime , he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group living in America . &quot;
&quot; SÃ¼@@ ver is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah GÃ¼@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact most Turks have no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared ErdoÄan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into trailer and opponent Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; clubs are not among the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at the &quot; Gala &quot; tro@@ phy winner , it will be back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top@@ scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory end . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ out @-@ kno@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also arrive early in the Europa League . &quot;
there was only rank six in the Swe@@ et Li@@ g .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we &apos;ve done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the playing year went better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season matches as SÃ¼@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ret@@ enk@@ Ã¶@@ nig presented the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason for the fans to continue hoping for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the time of AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez , which was only lo@@ aned under contract under the agreement of AC Florence , was announced after the coup attempt , not to return to his European holiday because of the political situation in the country . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in order to do so , the farmer would have to be willing to ab@@ stain from around one @-@ third of his estimated annual salary to around one @-@ third of his estimated 7.5 million Euro , &quot; Or@@ man stated clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other le@@ ased Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fe@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing barrier shortly before the games , was whi@@ pped off mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 m breast ) . &quot;
it was a bizarre scene : with a smiling smile she was still stum@@ bling into the hall and had provoked her appearance .
&quot; when it became clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a rush @-@ storm . &quot;
but there are still numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to shut off a six month lock after it was proven taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong tooth ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied any deliber@@ ate in@@ takes and was locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested in 2010 positively and locked for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible for eu@@ pon .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title for testosterone abuse in 2006 .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world champion and gold @-@ favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive in May , but may still be launched in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence was found to take a banned food supplement , the ban on the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on 13 July . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Foreign Ministry spokes@@ man , Thomas Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered sec@@ tioning and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , also Austrian citizens , are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ Ã¶@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a life district of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Thai woman was killed and 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and another person was killed , according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; in Ph@@ u@@ ket , too , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions . &quot;
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban employee .
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explosive charges have gone into the air in front of the territorial police territory . &quot;
&quot; finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called for several injuries in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ eastern coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to comment on possible motives , but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they have not been informed of the exact time and locations . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; police advised their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not address tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the nun@@ ci@@ ated bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends its website to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for any necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; head of Jun@@ ta and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ rest , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , was able to lead the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ S@@ hr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Affairs .
&quot; after several national offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said the German press agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate , the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
this is why we now observe the movement as well .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ WÃ¼rttemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ it@@ ous advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda aims to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly susceptible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports from several federal states on the contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , for that he did not have any findings . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; they expressed concern about the fact that many raid on the account of people , who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum shel@@ ters had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that had previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; not always , the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia sh@@ ook so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more famous in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
some media referred him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea swimming pool , when he had to compete on his own in a subur@@ b of 100 metres . &quot;
&quot; f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - the owner of a shop on the new square has been best@@ owed .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 pm and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;

there is no CC@@ TV surveillance as well .
Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so closely
&quot; the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida . &quot;
&quot; if there &apos;s nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already had an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , but it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; in his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
mail is increasing in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously large .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; as of next year , the post wants to offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market . &quot;
&quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , even to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO JÃ¼rgen Ger@@ da had said that there will always be questions , such as tra@@ des@@ people . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner group intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in the post @-@ owned factory . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ da announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run a complete change to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we surrounded the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership fails after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges Matthias Hart@@ mann &apos;s boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot;
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ad@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the forefront of the market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appo@@ inting figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the world &apos;s number five in the industry faces a new beginning . &quot;
the G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Grin@@ ert has already been dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
&quot; as early as 1 September , the management board of the Management Board will take over the current Executive Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; Executive Officer &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details didn &apos;t want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
those who will be conducting market research in the future will be unclear at this time .
&quot; in investor circles , it was said that on Friday , in the shareholders , the disappointment on the continued success of the restructuring measures initiated several years ago was large . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been the Gf@@ K leader since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every investor will eventually become uns@@ ett@@ led . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at â¬ 36@@ 2m , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 per cent , with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros . &quot;
earnings in the second quarter were above all imp@@ acted by the company &apos;s lower value in view of its difficult economic situation .
&quot; the Group &apos;s business value depreci@@ ation , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , tot@@ aled EUR 14@@ 8.2 million under the line @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ oud in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
&quot; in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the deta@@ inees suffered serious injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her information , according to an opposite vice , which partly drove on the opposite lane . &quot;
the bus stopped right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire service liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to Kr@@ um@@ m@@ oud &apos;s P@@ ew@@ sum district .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report themselves to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic metre sewage range from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World leg 3,@@ 44 instead of EUR 2.@@ 10 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ hÃ¤user ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget by the County Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach noted that under@@ cover works for these sewage plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ covering basis . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and trade and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ te berg will have to get deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Director of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and / or under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period should be equ@@ alled . &quot;
Schmidt explained the grave fee increases with the fact that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
&quot; for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low de@@ part@@ mental basis . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three facilities is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair costs were considerable in all three plants , not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant had to be replaced as a result of damage .
&quot; after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be evacu@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge disposed of and an additional ventilation opportunity had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period came to these extraordinary expenses .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that during the low waste water fall in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; fully sm@@ ashed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of major maintenance costs in the se@@ wer systems in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to the view of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , particularly as the utility area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility company will not be able to expand these facilities because it concerns public defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell on clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
the &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
&quot; Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , the Snap@@ chat allows approximately 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps come to the public .
&quot; in the past , the Snap@@ chat filters have critici@@ zed criticism in which they were accused of having the app called Black@@ face Pro@@ mot@@ ing or White Skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yellow @-@ face &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversi@@ es had shown a bigger problem that the company has a diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had disabled the feature . &quot;
the company provided an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ Ã©s . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace wrote Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et spread far beyond the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and the least unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very nasty Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filtering effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not si@@ ghted , but that the yellow face was drawn into the degra@@ ding extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents in terms of race - might expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel responsible , focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; military leadership distor@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground , a committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican Members of the Com@@ mit@@ ee Committee , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and the Com@@ par@@ ative Committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence gathering information , typically printed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com commands , regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when it allowed actual states on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ Com extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com spokes@@ man announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge , while the investigations will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations in the Cent@@ Com reports are being carried out by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday which coinci@@ ded with some of the implications of the Repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; stated the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the Committee of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , Mr Schiff said , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the moral under analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said no evidence to be found at the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts in regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were admitted to Cent@@ Com analy@@ st complaints . &quot;
&quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has since been made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush advanced a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that , contrary to the government statements , air strikes against the government held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the USA win fourth match in the women &apos;s field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday , against India , that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember having ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ on on the first place that will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will conver@@ ge on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; first placed , the strong Dutch will take a little longer to lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game starts on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a hockey player in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympic Games in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better one . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental shift and a physical change , &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to ro@@ b the ru@@ dder completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a reco@@ il from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team looked surprisingly tough and held the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and le@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the United States , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the ro@@ aring of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel steady and ines@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from cross@@ bow protection to s@@ wimm@@ ers for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples , could well have been among those well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : gun fire , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I have a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ sely noticed for the last 16 years that many who I had questioned were not aware that it is at all an Olympics version . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to contest , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
&quot; trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but just an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has a hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and scuba diving , the two sports that it essentially combines . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic program , you will be judged according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , medal @-@ hop@@ pers must go further , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the television broadcast also another great goal : that of the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the goal oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even beat a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel tired when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down , then effort@@ lessly back upwards . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the fin@@ ders as part of a follow @-@ up block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the obj@@ ecting of male athletes , as the male US gym@@ n@@ ors recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community to breathe in air . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia imp@@ elled the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ shots .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ attered the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to take a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness now explo@@ de after years of the H@@ ink@@ el@@ ihood beneath the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through the social media , because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave an idea that they gathered in such a way as protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ har@@ as , predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ mo@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ er dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in a non @-@ public disease . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ enam@@ el Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ enam@@ el comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ esting , apparently ple@@ dged by the government according to analysts , and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even though they were less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest continued relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conduct of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ mic town , led by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ri@@ ly that his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings about his fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump revers@@ ed on the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was totally serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism r@@ att@@ les down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he declared &quot; &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic fron@@ tiers in politics and then row back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then if necessary clarify &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive sound , as his survey values declined further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump j@@ okes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand for him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the tr@@ umps of prominent advoc@@ ates , gave a great deal of trouble to the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ul@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , where Mrs. Clinton was serving as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread aggres@@ sively in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around and being taken against him on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ologies as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once talked about the price of the market , CafÃ© is back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a small cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of Bed@@ ford Avenue store front . &quot;
soap Cher@@ ie shop selling Ver@@ b in Summer 2014 sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people smoked it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafÃ© , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a great deal . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese on the menu , and there are gar@@ n@@ ages like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ Ã©@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural tear@@ ing dishes .
&quot; the cafÃ© does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also replaced by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club on a regular basis . &quot;
&quot; even after she went to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the club closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the club that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and inevitably ordered the same . &quot;
&quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for tasting with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the cafÃ© as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the cafÃ© . &quot;
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has preferred to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the cafÃ© is expanded to a neighbouring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafÃ© closed .
&quot; when the new cafÃ© opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coff@@ ees felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a passion for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ Ã¢@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land tor@@ to@@ ise soup . &quot;
&quot; its menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , m@@ ashed with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cream cheese and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap , which the ingredient extends . &quot;
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts to serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; women &apos;s teams cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways that the country was dealing with it , not to be the land of junk . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as exciting : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ole were found to be stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; &quot; noted Ziegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the focal point of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange bl@@ ends have been tried out , since a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have such an influence on the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budget politicians &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ fold man of the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the preten@@ ce of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Roos@@ ev@@ elt led to the White House having produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most desolate . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple presented the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot;
there was the case of the wind@@ fall .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e made a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt would eat at noon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a usual trick to miss a modest reception . &quot;
&quot; there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved some reluct@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it didn &apos;t taste bad . &quot;
Co@@ E thri@@ ved three times .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do budget worker he said to his wife , &quot; Some hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
&quot; killed in bombing , he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo &quot;
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar gave his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into play in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian guard , showing him an 11 @-@ hour rescu@@ ing of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; he never saw himself as a hero , but he said , &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar himself attacked the victim himself , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters dis@@ car@@ ded four drum bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , which was filled with chl@@ oric gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland H@@ arks usually only come to the surface in winter .
&quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea aboard the S@@ anna research ship . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland ha@@ ie will only get offspring with 150 years .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour , it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a rich 2.@@ 6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , shaped by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science , at least from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the bi@@ ologist gu@@ essed for a long time that Greenland ha@@ i@@ red would become stone . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers have little knowledge of the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
they measured their slow pace as they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of the S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; this sh@@ arks still make this prey : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; they may hunt sleep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and seek car@@ c@@ asses , which tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water layers down . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the deep of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the iron core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks notably had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l core .
&quot; her birth was therefore to lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons hunt more volumes of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ l core contained a slight surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , all the larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucleus , which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers is even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ Ã¶n@@ land hai @-@ females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers of the length could assign an old age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the increase obviously allows for at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
the fact that such methane can live mainly in icy waters is not by chance .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was captured in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a spar@@ ring . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building site in a double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on matters relating to building construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; at last the marketing of recently designated residential buildings can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ zel@@ li@@ fication and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Street weg &quot; and &quot; SchÃ¶@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straÃe ) no longer stands in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural districts of SchÃ¶@@ nau are appealing to young families and former senior citizens alike .
&quot; as it was said , bau@@ bles can now announce themselves in the town hall , via the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to make inquiries about the settlement of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan which was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area that has been designated there is extended by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main , therefore , has the best opportunities in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract more jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , approval in the UK is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot;
that &apos;s why big US banks are using this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs to be deployed in the Main , within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk association ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg fav@@ ours a large fund industry , but it also cuts out worse in infrastructure than Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city has easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find vac@@ ant high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lÃ¤nder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , tenants for first @-@ class commercial properties are around 50 percent higher than on the river Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company &apos;s consulting services Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked seventh , Luxemburg in number 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US in@@ verter decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs derived from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was released from a compensation pa@@ yout of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck is trying to connect with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and claim ownership of laboratory work which sof@@ os@@ bu@@ y@@ clo@@ vir is due to active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say they have re@@ conquered full control over Man@@ i from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the United States have rec@@ ap@@ tured the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ i near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb@@ ats after the departure of the remaining group of fighters , who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they set free over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ jah &apos;s wish of the Man@@ i military Council Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are running clean@@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton released their tax declaration for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the Democrats &apos;s presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton had an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their book about their term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declarations of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and retreat in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal to have a tax check through the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; stated Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the democr@@ ats presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax inspections were not completed . &quot;
&quot; the critics , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the topic and released a video on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump asks to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reported that in the 1990s , Tr@@ ump did not pay any or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people earn the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump was afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clinton Doc@@ tors of 2015 showed that they only purchased USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a low @-@ cost index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ bu@@ der , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going home inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ bu@@ ster .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ ance Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensified its promotion along with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harvesting without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Call Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ ance Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot;
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth , ch@@ ili@@ bu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned on to the spark plug . &quot;
&quot; when lit , the con@@ dom p@@ ushes up with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ bu@@ der in the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er shooting a piece of gold in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
Stad@@ thalle decides unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Investment Plan of traders with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and is considered to be significantly exp@@ and@@ able for retail in the core city . &quot;
&quot; however , the town council rejected the application for the new construction of a sales ski@@ pper near the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony in the building . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in a prominent location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after an &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots ex@@ po@@ unded a media record after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin didn &apos;t list any Israeli pre @-@ election because it would have claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his recent stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of countries in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and extingu@@ ished ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to select Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was an &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it solved even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ blatt called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet , where people called it a scandal . &quot;
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given up the supposed re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; she said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located in the noble Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to not include Israel in the electoral list , &quot; the SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo , when they gathered to protest the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to dis@@ assemble the students , which led to police officers and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the participants of the protest saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts spra@@ ying against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who was removed from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gl@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the Russian ambassador in Iran . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gl@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is talking about a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , Russian foreign representatives accounted for about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses for : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ Ã¶l fell victim
a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ raid on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL was practi@@ sed at the Wald@@ br@@ Ã¶@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the issu@@ ance of cash from the staff of the beverage market and subsequently fled initially on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
the police do not share how much money has been exploited .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 metres tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and badly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the raid on Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , the perpetr@@ ators must be fled to Ger@@ ber@@ straÃe , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( hit ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the socio @-@ pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ et@@ akers during their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf , near MÃ¼h@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet area of Lei@@ tw@@ el@@ dle , the fun @-@ loving group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on one hand we went to B@@ save with the visit of the stro@@ lling zoo .
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ et@@ akers have been treated for culinary delights such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ Ã¤tz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ Ã¤n@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ Ã¼b@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , b@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children laugh@@ ed at home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ ei@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch ( St. Anna ) were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ ish pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the St. Anna Council of Ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were examined and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at the Freiburg Cathedral . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ haus , went their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , Father Stor@@ es sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and granted the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b there was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Un@@ ser@@ er loved wife and so the pilgri@@ m was started from MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; each day was accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts in the morning and evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made up at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly to sing a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song book . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the parish dormit@@ ories of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a delicious and strengthening dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to GÃ¼@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; on top of that , one stepped onto the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at first about 500 meters of altitude had to be desc@@ ended and climbed again afterwards . &quot;
the deserved reward was a communal barbecue at Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Frei@@ burger MÃ¼nster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot;
&quot; in the evening mass in MÃ¼nster , the Min@@ is received by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med at home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner spent the last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
&quot; the 23 year old from Glas@@ gow took the anch@@ or@@ age , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself his own . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
&quot; they repeated the trick , having only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s res@@ ignation . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Tony &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , running in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked out from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ di when they got onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and to give me a name .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is possible to repeatedly win Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the case of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll , qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race . &quot;
&quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
&quot; he had cont@@ ested yesterday with officers before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie won in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 in the corresponding women &apos;s competition . &quot;
the GB team relies on his strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a crowd to med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly exceptional portra@@ yal of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April was surrounded by sex and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ stran@@ ts as well as the retirement of gre@@ ats such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus raises all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is exp@@ iring in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the sm@@ el@@ ting consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the point Henry Schmel@@ z , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and la@@ stly due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ ash with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the sm@@ el@@ ting process , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties were &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging businesses &quot; &quot; that would have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L earnings from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by predic@@ ting the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts already depreci@@ ated in its annual slu@@ dge , amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting , or to ensure the supply of electricity to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; is not com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation of why it has been withdrawn from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and a total of 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts per year . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and that would not be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner clan is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , shared reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the universally popular show bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ Ã©@@ d story of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a play@@ field at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly started . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for Vo@@ gue covers ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see this in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a picture band rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still went through before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner , who is described as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , falls under the former category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if it applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success doesn &apos;t appeal to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner critic@@ ised her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mist@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were too high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ fortune , it seems to pass by at the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures of them on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
&quot; she sells her pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine &quot; &quot; W@@ TV &quot; . &quot; &quot;
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal Light Centr@@ es annually reject 160@@ ,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s most emergency services are rejected annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry is taking on the effects of further mi@@ dd@@ le@@ ties on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell Municip@@ alities said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year .
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation would only get worse without the resolution of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations , workers who have been released un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Federal justice minister and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for assistance to the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community care centres and their customers &quot; communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employee alleged weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign was indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action , after telling her that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on an employee in February , while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an In@@ dict@@ ment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte District Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months for the matter to be controlled internally , before realizing that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after he compla@@ ined to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the prosecution ended only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a ri@@ ot when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival was elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint Ju@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; it was clear that the media had torn his words out of context , and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot;
ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and of Philip on account of body injury and lasting mental damage .
hope Hi@@ cks was not able to access Tr@@ ump spokes@@ woman in hope Hi@@ cks .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; did not respond to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services . &quot;
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .
&quot; the procedure is B@@ ord@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the government parties of the SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot;
these are representative surveys of the IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black governing coalition could barely go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before five years to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite the slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were reluct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; with each 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD &apos;s vote in Berlin came to only 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they were thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time .
&quot; in contrast to 2011 , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return by 5 percent . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
&quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot;
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would extend today for roughly two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , fans can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone maker announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West ash format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could set a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator to reach . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , even if tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
vendors today dominate the market that came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is everyday life for a lot of people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales with the tools are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the introduction of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the following . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; today , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of staff at the Siemens Board of Management . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already offering 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blin@@ ding on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had been wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each asked question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , Â£ 2@@ 11 billion in wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a Â£ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to supply a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by Â£ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad block@@ age &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , one of the software vendors is trying to b@@ ypass ad block@@ age , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ing block@@ ings on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ launch advertising on the social network . &quot;
Facebook shared Facebook with the fact that its desktop site would change the coding regarding its advertisements to make it adver@@ sely affecting the recognition of which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of hard @-@ and @-@ forth fight between the opening open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicating block@@ ers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study conducted last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use ad block@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertis@@ ers account for 84 percent of their advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokes@@ man announced that the company has no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile ad block@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook seems worthwhile to invest in such a step . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preferences &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an email communication . &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool which is why we instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control in people &apos;s hands .
woman suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 in the proximity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these and every witness of the incident instruc@@ ts to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers didn &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the motorway in the middle of the night , as was said in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder after she over@@ came and killed a man who died in August 2014 of a night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and , on the road , had become unconscious , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation &quot; , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should notify the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected conditions similar to its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also prof@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution , which was previously suspected by planet scientists . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
her oceans were evapor@@ ated and her steam was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen escaped , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as Trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations on Thursday and led to a slight co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly tailored to the organisation &apos;s needs . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick told me today about this decision , &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy has won the 2013 A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league . &quot;
&quot; he took the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years . &quot;
&quot; in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference at five points . &quot;
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two songs with the Montreal Canadian and A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers have resum@@ ed talks , put strike &quot;
&quot; labour disputes with respect to wages for North Sea workers are suspended , while all parties sit down at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the present dispute , &quot; &quot; states a common statement . &quot;
we will stop several full @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this year , Wood Group has cut the rates to its counter@@ parties in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lined its operations as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ade
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ade star cluster .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star @-@ loops rotate to different rates , and in what context the rotation time frames stand with planet origin . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star establishments , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large quantities of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turn more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ade we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades Stern@@ enh@@ aufen offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us about what we want to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang on their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ ade Rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base to Base .
&quot; following his emotional recall , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star player of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature has been signed by 27 million US dollars . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid off for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 year old should not be included in the Hall of Gl@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star reported on &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have taken the banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the prime suspect to have been receiving benefits from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could have done me a favour for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time swe@@ at@@ y . &quot;
&quot; his departure days , too , are not silent . &quot;
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have survived the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails an attempt to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an ear@@ thy athlete would have won almost one medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become famous for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athletic competitions , these news are at the end of the season . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 year old took fourth place in the final about 100 m of butter@@ flies , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have attended the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; said the athlete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the forbidden substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe must have been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported to the bul@@ letin with criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation may not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case called &quot; Adrian Dest@@ in@@ sky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested three days ago positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both of them contest the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the entire Russian squ@@ ad to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the country of Kenya producing numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition to swimming , the former prisoners in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations between the athletes . &quot;
Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium with more than 200 m of free style , I want to pass , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focus of an engagement with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down for a three month lock . &quot;
&quot; data theft : as per@@ fi@@ de , hack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som &quot;
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware currently attack companies - and they are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already aiming for ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som sal@@ ted by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
&quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize increasingly on attacks in corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be pressed falls considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently monitoring a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks was frigh@@ tening fast over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ases the origin@@ als in a sustainable way .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls if a ran@@ som@@ ware is added . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German companies affected reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to fully inter@@ rupt their business activity , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data once more .
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in view of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
&quot; hack@@ ers , in turn , know that and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the use areas and contact with the black@@ ma@@ ders and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they tell their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ code for free for example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate roughly and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their malware then in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the existing malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself , counsel@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the delivery includes a matching tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ders then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so , one logs in on one of the for@@ ts in the underground , bu@@ ys the set by a criminal and further commissions it to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is per authenti@@ cated computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers to spread , &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpetr@@ ators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also face completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; on the de@@ con chi@@ pper conference , safety researchers demonstrated how to control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda plans to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the rear . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit surface is slightly different . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l when raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like seats , thus providing storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do his job somewhat more quietly . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the &quot; Executive &quot; top version , the equipment does not leave any wishes un@@ fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when required .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with its HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline cannot be held liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht DÃ¼sseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only with hazards that are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of disease : when paid by the organis@@ er
&quot; after their trip , sick leave only gets money when the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; this is , however , only the case when more than ten percent of the guests admit the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; during the trial , a family was seriously ill with diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of their holiday . &quot;
she spent nearly the entire holiday in the room .
their disease returned the holiday@@ makers to a defective sewage plant that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip had been insufficient - and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the promot@@ er learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion to one another - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people worried about further attacks . &quot;
&quot; the state must be pru@@ dent , and at the same time determined to respond to terrorist attacks . &quot;
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and spl@@ itting . &quot;
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , they hei@@ gh@@ ten the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re wants to implement proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in the medium @-@ fourth magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
promoting terrorism should again be punished .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the right to weapons will be am@@ ended so that the purchase of weapons in the internet is ham@@ pered . &quot;
the recently discussed Swiss duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be maintained in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨res &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions , how to reduce the risk of citizens , he said with a view of mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in pursuit of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; said SPD chief Gabriel : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against action .
&quot; this was an ear@@ ring for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ Ã¨re had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
he considers that a general prohibition of full @-@ conce@@ al@@ ment is problematic under constitutional law .
&quot; you can &apos;t ban everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; talk about rules , for example in road traffic , or for witnesses in court . &quot;
green boss Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and action .
&quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger , left @-@ wing party leader , said : &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence permit people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway junction
it st@@ owed regularly on the circum@@ fer@@ ential road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right of law should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic jams , if they ride over the motorway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction sector extends over the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the descent of Wes@@ eler StraÃe , by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then drive directly from Hammer Street to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is divided in an early period , thus improving the total waste time on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straÃe 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of &quot; &quot; MÃ¼nster @-@ West &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ gh@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the descent of Wes@@ eler StraÃe .
&quot; from here , traffic is only given a trace on the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : structural calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity , in order to be able to record heavy traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related work @-@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent national operation cannot fail . &quot;
&quot; however , years can be expected : because the bridge has an official remaining time until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the right of law , the state of the country deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities to reck@@ on . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday , traffic is passed on to the construction site . &quot;
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has an idea of the prize @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the young theater in MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel , &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the staging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome groups the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; most of the youngsters in the classroom were from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to MÃ¼nster , among others , between September 2015 and March 2016 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , thus the press release of the young theater in MÃ¼nster . &quot;
&quot; founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , the N@@ ima &apos;s Association , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Junge Theater will work together as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language placement are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope of weather improvement
the weather has made the star schn@@ u@@ ppen Gu@@ eber@@ gers in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night to Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ des , which are one of the quick@@ est shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us rising up in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep far in front of the alarm bells . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ GÃ¼nter We@@ eÃ , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one sees in the meantime , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a distur@@ b@@ ance and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; many people feel inadequate to sleep as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the Board of Directors of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot;
sleep disorder is often an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is common especially in case of depression , &quot; she says . &quot;
and it can be that various factors are subject to one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , let &apos;s get an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep problems become a doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is impaired in the day , visit your doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; in order to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Char@@ itÃ© University Medicine Berlin , is hardly available in Germany . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , one should first contact the doctor in case of sleep problems . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what &apos;s happening ?
&quot; in the case of snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , in case of ill @-@ suffering daily fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is drawn to the ceiling for sleeping . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws to fix for a better sleep .
&quot; if you don &apos;t sleep in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , avoid watching alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ en has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a short @-@ time world championships and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ en has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate in front of his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ate .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives â¬ 20,000 rewards and a jungle King 150@@ ,000 â¬ should not be surprised , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in swimming is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see it as closely or even operate it on the subject of dop@@ ing .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ det had to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly the way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled for a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger who now operates an ice cream shop . &quot;
airport : gang of luggage rob@@ bers arrested
professional thi@@ eves at DÃ¼sseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civilians of the DÃ¼sseldorf police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
&quot; as a gang , the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and bags of luggage . &quot;
&quot; at 9 : 30 pm , civil servants in the area of the DÃ¼sseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to the polic@@ emen from past anti @-@ theft crimes . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year and , in doing so , proc@@ eeded to work in a community , work @-@ hard and very professional manner . &quot;
the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ ers Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves who had come to Germany especially for the prevention of criminal off@@ ences .
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of more than 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in has no effect at first sight , but the police count it to the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a freshly @-@ coated kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ dish . &quot;
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , however , article about this &quot; trendy city &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor rooms are still occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel had spoken several times for the police action against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June , the premises on the ground floor , the car@@ c@@ asses , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three men on the ground , locked out parts of the road and kept visitors away from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evi@@ ction had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers removed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i . &quot;
a primary school and nursery schools are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects .
&quot; left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who runs three children here , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the building projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a neighborhood that vo@@ iced police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing lef@@ ti@@ sts .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make up between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; home occup@@ ations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighborhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer StraÃe close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under great police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ sters from around the world : with them now residents from East Germany and former home occup@@ ants share their neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on the thrown discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were car@@ ded with color @-@ bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; Left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the off@@ enses make damage to property , which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ ghty : people in the 94 are their neighbors , they have not been . &quot;
the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the architect architect , her street is not a criminal approach , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and has remained .
&quot; this is why it was so important for them to get back their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents , such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former premises , which supp@@ ress the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well sto@@ cked , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot approve of violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should one do if someone never stops ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for those who are fond of color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belong to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; those who pull , should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a pub , can complain poorly about noise there . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group for refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here , the ice @-@ loving wo@@ ollen mil@@ ch@@ ee , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write out the place . &quot;
&quot; an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , was sought after . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position satisfied on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers are soon to be found in the Was@@ en@@ straÃe
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must place the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the administrative district office to the commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work to rely on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , congregations have to be consolidated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straÃe . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; Per@@ spective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be consolidated or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not &quot; &quot; employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; activity , however , does not only mean labour . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , says Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; thus , here too , administration and volunteers are jumping . &quot;
it is essential that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; those who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there are problem cases also , says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing is concerned . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always also to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after recent incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what some may call na@@ Ã¯@@ ve . &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely away .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and honorary members must look for activities on site and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they have always in the background that a new impulse could soon come to Ur@@ bach as refugees and migrants . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is unfair to place them on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the arch@@ ies are already at full capacity to integrate the existing people sensi@@ bly .
&quot; currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters wanted
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
&quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot;
the occup@@ ants surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ den in the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled towards the city center .
&quot; as a reminder , the police deployed several crew squ@@ ads and a police helicopter . &quot;
the for@@ ging went without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown were , indeed , close to the apartment or during their escape . &quot;
