<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they chased home to feed the feed in a fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And with it the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday was Germany's best golfer all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the annex of the ALRV, he swung to a horse not even for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for a long time, the first time was in Aachen and therewith also at the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Mixed Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable sportsman does not lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the Sport pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporty successes but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masterswinner was shot at the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the distinguished members include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the founder, Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper of Alwin Schockemehle and posthumously the hand baller Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports leagues came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion, where the laurel price was running."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economists Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep them small and warn about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, allegations Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively restrain regulation, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to open disadvantages to disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes would increase for the rich," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in order to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost silent."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate terminates the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be party-internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and to drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement aims to terminate it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their investment programme, Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly expand the renewable energies and demand:" a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign the two."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, however, both don't want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better, for example, Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: one time he says: the minimum wage has to be rattled, then he says he can't be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months will probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, is about to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics argue, that the budget deficit would only increase."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every escaped wife has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby who is at the most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son into the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He glanced curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Executive Director of Condrobs, a supporter of social welfare services in Bavaria, and, among other things, deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-minded women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs launched the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid Association."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman arriving here has experience with sexual violence on her flight," Bahr recalls. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families will send them to Europe as a hope of hope." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly, because they do not see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this continues."</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and at worst misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results in the fact that about 90 per cent of women residing in the North of Munich are traumatized, they estimate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they dare not speak openly about what we experienced, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't know how to help, more accommodations just need for them, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project as in Munich, some of them answer no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accomodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, fledged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are storeys or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the" "Women's Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "committee also calls for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are home separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washing rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women, is included in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection, one can read at the rush that there is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"having talked about that there is, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistants of the assistants have called upon their union to approve new work campaign measures in their disputes relating to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire Council to approve more work campaigning from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC announced that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persevering calm "to problems, which led to the rejection of the Treaty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In consideration of this, the JDC committee has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and demand official new negotiations for all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the government's silence, the President of the JDC has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work of action that begins in early September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that, six times, assistance specialists strike the first total failure in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistance specialists Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions that had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the sessions that took place prior to the vote by 54,000 resident doctors and medical students, with the conclusion that the contract was to be advantageous and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite player in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles seemed slippery, and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a paper describing that Erdogan had behaved as if it had never happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state did not forget anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was wildly burning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the decline was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the cousin will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack against Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his office last month at a failed coup d'Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemographic put it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued resentment on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"at the same time, the Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara to demand support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d" Ã©tat. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an" alliance of outsiders "to Russia and Turkey: two countries, who were violated and treated badly by the West, and now joined together."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they hadn't even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter, it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Â£1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blowers" "approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical cables."</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last part of the deck receives a juggling for the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the shutter is the trendsetting high and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower in the extension, we had to close the existing gap on the north or side of the land."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, since the Viadukt is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances on which the team were working, they were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who will build cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens say: investors should in future be taken much more strongly into the duty.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you respond to the bad news that in the next few years Brunswick will lose almost 1300 inexpensive apartments?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD, for the next council session, proposes a" living concept for action. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments actually?"</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the town hall is, however, says Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann," There is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few prescriptions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants more hardy conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, according to Bratmann, a tightening of the situation is on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do we compensate for the loss of other around 1300 inexpensive apartments whose support will continue in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased on-going bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one blow the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city there are deadlines at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not mean the owners and the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically, it is removed from the goal of the so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socialists in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will be even more movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D Group president Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in fact, I concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes."</seg>

<seg id="1">"PokÃ©mon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it"</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time in staring on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am referring to the PokÃ©mon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s (later arose a series of animations, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been shifted by massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, PokÃ©mon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for PokÃ©mons that are tracked with a GPS and as soon as they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when it was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the" average "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiff, an Apple Watch app that followed 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise 30 minutes each day, from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays the PokÃ©mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health who want to bring people" "to come from the sofa" "and" "active every day" "stumbled on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the Wonderful thing about PokÃ©mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also mooky game-perils, which always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk around a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"thanks to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the asset in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalists and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallists Aliya Mustafina.</seg>

<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated her sport the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina was easily led by two turns, the picture blew."</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beams and ground-ages - in which Biles holds the world title - was lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she recovered again with 15,433 on the brim beam, and placed one on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her duodenum - a pure formality - and tears poured into fine red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called" "grandma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and this for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympiad of the Olympic and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterly gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual campaigning event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turns are a more expensive sport and that Turner is primarily involved in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents responsible for training, training, travel apparel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their Turner and Families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both athletes since they started the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the congregations out innumerable young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing a more affordable and easy-to-access gym."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my 20-year foundation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "culture of Political Correctness will thrive electoral fraud in Muslim areas" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office last year</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles addresses the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Government, who is now an antonialist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of elective booths in order to protect frightened voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a badge to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the moment, a voter only has to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger, when they submit their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in the East of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lutsk Rahman was supposed to be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "cynical" and that he had silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic allegations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person was chosen as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm to the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading ID cards to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it says:" evidence has been made to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There have been concerns that... State institutions have unknowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity concerning ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit letters of letters to stop" "electoral harvests." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigrant and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider choosing voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has submitted her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications for an automatic letter code.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition of political activists to process full postal selections and envelopes of letters of mail.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up barriers for electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in legislation facilitated by an indictment for intimidation according to the 1983 Representation of the People Act (People's Documents Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Ban on photographing in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement for only English to be used in election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go into the electoral cabin alone."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal complaint was placed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral district has declared Luton Rahman and his substitute for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unfit," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "check-out controls" of the City Hall's election registrations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the buyers did not know where to look, when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mark to try bottoms."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in order to make the situation worse, she looked at how she looked at it, pulled it off and put her back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">She continued to rummage and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Mall in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Primark shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear, she went back and left the shop without purchasing anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the showroom, she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, pulled out her own stockings and trousers and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she didn't even try to find a somewhat discreet location to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when she withdrew the pants, which you obviously did not like, as she put her back on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same thing with three other pants, before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, attracted again and went out."</seg>

<seg id="15">"Mrs. Davidson:" "as I got along, the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new couple and find out that another woman had her and went out and didn't get washed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a spokesman for Primark said," Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folkstone. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"when approaching from behind you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" get out of the shot, "Mizrachi says."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat it with your knee in the lath and twist, while the attacker curbs from pain, the weapon comes out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"simultaneously shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its handle before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a travel guide his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler pulled off his immune system and sausage eflex of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"presenter and tour author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk schabte his course on a Euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before completing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to take."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the idea of leaking the rinsing button of a tensile toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he was leaking, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money at stations to flushing out of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said," As a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to live up to his reputation in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial screed showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminometric number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the guide film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in various places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This comes close to the worst I have geroed in a toilet. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valio Senior's President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming by saying "Let's Ian call us."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had checked out some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the ecelly Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their social housing after a delogistration with a damage of Â£50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had gaping holes, wood planks were roughed, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, working for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in that way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror which the family had joined, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, strife and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an order for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old garbage has been found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were roughed"</seg>
<seg id="15">"neighbours said they had to fight them on the street, and had to be invoked regularly by the police."</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended term of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one of them said," They didn't care for anybody. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now that they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had agreed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">On the high-level side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the renter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogization is always the last step taken into account Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community courageously approached us and gave us the information provided."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">"a dirty mattress, which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloging on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70g of cannabis and scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of Â£1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after having become guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial law.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they are occupying tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the Police of Devon and Cornwall announced that the delogification was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self reproaches, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behavior," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate any criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"until 2021, the state election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid as yet, it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites."</seg>

<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, RÃ¼gen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the land tag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays there are helpers who hang posters, inflate the balloons, distribute flyers and count at the end of counting, just rubbing laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign in close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how strong newbie AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive electoral campaign, one sees from his large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, spreads roses and chats a bit with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seering got cold feet and chancellor Merkel is blaming the AfD's thrill."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" "We create it" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make electoral campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's federal election circle is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group was not right, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel."</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the north-east CDU largely waives the usual campaign booths on market places and in front of shopping centers with sunshades and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, according to Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that in the country, the base is crumbling, that it has to strain itself very hard to find a wire to the people again."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30am in the morning and end only at 8 p.m., there are everywhere praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite jagged," Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the reciprocity of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of occupations."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the frozen section of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg was resumed, the traffic situation within the village was relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now continue on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive passage through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," "said the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the restoration of the rehabilitation department."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bachbruk, SteinlachstraÃe, HafnerstraÃe and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many bleaching paths were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were hiding in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality demanded more of the show vehicle from MÃ¶ssingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable exaggerations," "says King, who made himself informed on the spot himself."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the way with 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27 refurbishment has led to breakthroughs among them, everyone you ask is scrutinized."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight decline", "but also admits that, of course," the running documents are missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited is the local bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert GÃ¶hner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants took it" hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We need to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as a result, the sales revenues are" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road marking has thrown back its operation" "for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, the president JÃ¶rg Schmidt announced on a request by GÃ¶hner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÃ¶hner knows from other counties, where such a more generous is handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all suits, GÃ¶hner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't travel, it's also somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">GÃ¶hner has no doubts that his stem cell comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, GÃ¶hner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in their long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re gives the sergeant.</seg>

<seg id="10">"however, as Minister of the Interior, he was on the basis of results and at a" realisable consensus "within the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, de MaiziÃ¨re had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for safety in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some have already been announced, announced, announced: that a new security authority will take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">"also, it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger passenger data and weapons law."</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies does not come as a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de MaiziÃ¨re is starting a second trial for proposals that had not yet to be done with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double nationality at the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he thinks it reasonable and doesn't demand anything that is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by De MaiziÃ¨re as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are in themselves: he is planning quick procedures for deportations and more opportunities for the detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically fetched into the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of Dulventions for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse still worse than so far - such as committing crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to obscure their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally sanctified.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are unexploited and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the imbalance of patient - for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de MaiziÃ¨re, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that have profoundly employed people let themselves not be clinging out even in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved enormously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="35">"on the subject of internal security, the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position."</seg>
<seg id="36">"over the past few days, between the two parties it was high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garrisky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, where the resort leaders also demand a Burka ban and a return from dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">"even here, de MaiziÃ¨re arves around irreconcilable sounds."</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't think of a return from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">"to reopen, do not make sense."</seg>
<seg id="42">And he has constitutional objections in case of a Burka ban.</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether his own package is unconstitutional at all corners and whether it is actually" reasonable "for the coalition partner, must still be shown."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in it that could take care of strife.</seg>

<seg id="16">"all in all, the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is further glimely due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a distribution minus of 0.9 percent is available to 3.37 million vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="17">"from January to July, Chief Executive Officer Fred Kappler continued to present a sales platform."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in this period, Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5,904 million worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with software exhaust gas tests.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops."</seg>

<seg id="33">"in customer interest, too, it is important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the scandal, comes to an insecurity with regard to possible warranty regulations, as it was said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comments section, to convict him under the pseudonym Non-allele male middle aged with harsh insults, this statement is derived from up-to-date data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the re-emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers usually retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and rode wild, before I stop, hold my hands and say something special:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly making its way to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand close to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I am of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared, and buy items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was a little too young to buy them," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records tend to be introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets to apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe, people who heard about the comeback and forced to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in trailers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took offence on the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, of objects that evoke happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or owning material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is the case with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people."</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to engage mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee flutes from a plate stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried, while strolling through a stack of bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Rooms: three men of middle aged), has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only recently came here and said," "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put it on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it will definitely happen."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-like, less music-like."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has an entertaining audience than I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage girls and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts offers the latest synthesize and sextpacked pop instead of experimental jazz out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but nailing mental trauma is hard to detach when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of records standing for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She's more of a window-stroll than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives away with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to braise the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a stairway, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one can see them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov are right, they are ignored, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumblebees on Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator who rises above the shoulders of no men of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses where people sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and sanity risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court with the fact that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely plausible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said that the food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely eating people who live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' CafÃ© of the Camp, which is operated by the community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' cafÃ©."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was" "for these children a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcomers over the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at the 7-day rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji presented a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line-running and raw power to win gold - her first medal of the Olympic medals of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the finals."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but, regardless of it, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis boss coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this cap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderfully and rained the attacks of GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for captain Tom Mitchell an and Co. on as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau crossed in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB didn't touch the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a preventative torch of Mitchell stopped the Berg of Man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute runner jasa Veremalua there was a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Nakarawa has added a new beginning, and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half."</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB has still been taught."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB resulted in basic changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova as a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sullians, whose fans sang, Fahnen waved and danced on the tribune."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than in these games and that wants what.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 harsh Hieve who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all there when they rowed to the second Olympics in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, who set such a standard."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolute, at least their 39.000 unspeakable commitment, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers that make up the incremental progress that make the difference, and no one was an assistant of the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a vacuous morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was a Captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "This week I was an emotional wreck."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it just repeats how much I have done, how much I and Helen and Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you to him. he's the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, panning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something good.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventure Steve Bakshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>

<seg id="15">"as outstanding events, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the refurbishment of the elevated tank (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the renovations of water pipes."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there has never been a standstill, and I have always added innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important foodstuff."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in her laudation, she praised GÃ¶llers faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years."</seg>
<seg id="18">"he has invested with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association, and he has lived through the water-purpose association as if it were his own company."</seg>
<seg id="19">"just a few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein group on the reduction of nitrate in front of the Unterfranken's waterforum."</seg>

<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as highlights from his point of view, he described the well-being and the restructuring of the purpose association."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the rupture at the elevated tank near Kirchlouder on a 3rd January."</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained because one filled the elevated tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel StÃ¼rmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert GÃ¶ller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition from the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) said the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to this, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel told the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissary Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent is tracked."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">This will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" Steel is Future, "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emission legislation," "explained IG Metall-CEO JÃ¶rg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation grew worse when the world's largest producer of producers threw large-scale steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on imported steel have an impact on imported steel. on the other hand, economic prospects have risen in China."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have been stagnating."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp finally did not want to exclude closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the produced amount went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year's figure."</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an increase in orders in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching of the teacher she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good with her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular gatherings, senior citizens can socialize and cultivate social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in a positive sense, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this reason, senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs will not get out of the puff quickly in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening to songs awakens memories of elderly people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are sinking to long-standing events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires a special performance, Lenz explains."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for something long, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">So there are enough reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">"whoever wants to try out a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have various options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings out of the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the Internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have examined in Hanover what effect the calls of cat's babies have on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">"to her surprise, the mistrust also did not leave the males cold - however, they always behaved alike in contrast to the females."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of arousal of babies at the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens, who think in great need, as scientists found out by the veterinary university and the Medical School of Hannover (MHH)."</seg>
<seg id="6">Hangovers are also responding to the calls of kittens - but always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"apparently the acoustic differences between the mistrust of less and strongly aroused young for the males are either not perceptible or not of importance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH. "</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous examination, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens scream differ with the urgency of their neediness."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight queens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">"they were screened to a herd of babies, who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and siblings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all the females, even those who had not yet their own offspring, reacted differentiated to the screams," "said Konerding."</seg>
<seg id="15">They swivel more quickly to the speaker when this cry of the very excited kittens was playing.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "said the biologist."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noise."</seg>
<seg id="19">"some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitive to infants, no matter whether they were already mothers or not, biologist Marina Scheumann reported."</seg>

<seg id="4">She planned her home journey for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chomphe, also Austrian citizens, are still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so SchnÃ¶ll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was initially exploded on Thursday evening in a life district of two bombs."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to police, a Thai woman was killed and 20 people were injured, among them the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Phuket, too, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the popular beach resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded which killed an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities in a flower bed, the explosive charges have gone into the air in front of the territorial police territory."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang called for several injuries in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-eastern coast."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee, Friday morning before journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to comment on possible motives, but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have received secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they have not been informed of the exact time and locations."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"police advised their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they do not address tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"according to the nunciated bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends its website to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need for any necessary travel to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"head of Junta and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unrest, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, was able to lead the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu-Shrine - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="2">"after several national offices, the conservationists in the Confederation have also placed the group under observation."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see the 'Identity Movement' indications for aspirations against the liberal democratic principles," "said the German press agency Hans-Georg Maate, the German press agency in Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="4">"thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diffused in extremist ways."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is why we now observe the movement as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identity Movement" is a grouping with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">"it turns against" "Multikulti-Wahn", "" "uncontrolled mass immigration" "and the" "loss of one's own identity through estrangement." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the" identities. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups such as the 'Identity Movement' attempt to pick up their target group where it stands," "said the chief of the Constitutional Court."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in general, extremists try to address them with a youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The faculties of Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a solicitous advertising for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda aims to address people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly susceptible.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there were reports from several federal states on the contacts of the" identities "to AfD politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, for that he did not have any findings."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, change their direction and become so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be rightist terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee camps or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a nationwide or pan-European control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"they expressed concern about the fact that many raid on the account of people, who did not appear in the right scene before."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects of attacks on asylum shelters had previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated offences or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that had previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who might have been politically indifferent, or voted for example CDU, SPD or Left, which, however, radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist sentiments."</seg>

<seg id="2">"not always, the Olympic Games or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia shook so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more famous in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred him as "Robel of Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" "prosperity bump", "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the Equatorial Guinea swimming pool, when he had to compete on his own in a suburb of 100 metres."</seg>
<seg id="21">"frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"the fees per cubic metre sewage range from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / World leg 3,44 instead of EUR 2.10; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (up to now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to now 2.18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the facility in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd SteinhÃ¤user (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the County Council of Kulmbach noted that undercover works for these sewage plants."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost-covering basis."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, citizens and trade and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulte berg will have to get deeper into the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Director of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and / or undercover from the preceding calculation period should be equalled."</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the grave fee increases with the fact that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low departmental basis."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three facilities is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age, refurbishment and repair costs were considerable in all three plants, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh ahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf sewage plant had to be replaced as a result of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be evacuated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation opportunity had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs that were to be taken into account in the new calculation period came to these extraordinary expenses.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">"stone houses made it clear that during the low waste water fall in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were" "fully smashed". ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of major maintenance costs in the sewer systems in the past 20 years, has been spared."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to the view of stone houses, the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long run, particularly as the utility area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility company will not be able to expand these facilities because it concerns public deficits."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, the Snapchat allows approximately 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein's painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, the Snapchat filters have criticized criticism in which they were accused of having the app called Blackface Promoting or White Skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "yellow-face". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies had shown a bigger problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company provided an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature from Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichÃ©s."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail Grace wrote Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet spread far beyond the photos that the filter was" hurting and the least unpleasant. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very nasty Asian caricature and filtering effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not sighted, but that the yellow face was drawn into the degrading extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents in terms of race - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of the Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racist-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, the Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently set up a personnel responsible, focusing on subrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence information, establishes Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground, a committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Commitee Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Comparative Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering information, typically printed by high-level CentCom commands, regularly recorded a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when it allowed actual states on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," "quoted a newspaper article."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the CentCom extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom spokesman announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge, while the investigations will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations in the CentCom reports are being carried out by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday which coincided with some of the implications of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom has created an overly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," stated the highest ranking democrat in the Committee of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, Mr Schiff said," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "damaged the moral under analysts and" gave excessively little room for divergent opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said no evidence to be found at the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts in regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, who were admitted to CentCom analyst complaints."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the general inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that has since been made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W.

<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday, against India, that the Americans won with 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Briton on the first place that will remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will converge on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">"first placed, the strong Dutch will take a little longer to lead the other group."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game starts on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey player in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympic Games in 2008, because she could not qualify for the Kader."</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to a better one."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental shift and a physical change," "said Bam."</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to rob the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Thursday evening, Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a recoil from the local area."</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team looked surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and lecked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the roaring of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rio de Janeiro's events feel steady and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from crossbow protection to swimmers for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples, could well have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: gun fire, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have a modest argument for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparsely noticed for the last 16 years that many who I had questioned were not aware that it is at all an Olympics version."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to contest, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">"trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has a humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending bounce - but also the grazie of gymnastics and scuba diving, the two sports that it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympic program, you will be judged according to version, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, medal-hoppers must go further, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, upwards and downwards at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the television broadcast also another great goal: that of the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even beat a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel tired when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">Forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes upwards, then down, then effortlessly back upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the finders as part of a follow-up block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objecting of male athletes, as the male US gymnors recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community to breathe in air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia impelled the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shattered the country and expanded into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to take a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, while dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of the Hinkelihood beneath the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through the social media, because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave an idea that they gathered in such a way as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of time, the Amharas, predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemmou, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairer dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in a non-public disease."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailenamel Desalegn, was chosen for relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailenamel comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005 after thousands of elections protesting, apparently pledged by the government according to analysts, and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even though they were less than in the last months and this period of unrest continued relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misconduct of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters attacked Gondar, an amharmic town, led by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by angrily that his repeatedly repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings about his fellow campaigners who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump reversed on the assertion on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was totally serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr Trump wanted to help weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism rattles down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he declared" "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic frontiers in politics and then row back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then if necessary clarify" "clarify" "according to how the reaction expires." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive sound, as his survey values declined further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand for him regardless of how provocatively his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the trumps of prominent advocates, gave a great deal of trouble to the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hulers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, where Mrs. Clinton was serving as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread aggressively in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around and being taken against him on each of his words."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apologies as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes last book" Chop Suey "was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, local snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Coe, 57, mashed with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>

<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways that the country was dealing with it, not to be the land of junk."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense issue," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as exciting: mysterious foods such as breads and casserole were found to be staple foods, the casserolle as a" "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," "noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dryfruit.</seg>

<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular supplement at noon," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelman continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"like never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have such an influence on the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" budget politicians "and the challenge of converting Pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historic delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports of the government's response to the hungry citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake-Essen-attitude, are particularly tasty."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the millionfold man of the world to whom he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine as fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor urged him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the pretence of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Roosevelt led to the White House having produced the most boring meal in Washington, but also one of the most desolate."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in writing the book, the couple presented the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law better understood - for example, how they could not throw away food."</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ziegelman recalled," "They really made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the case of the windfall.</seg>

<seg id="50">"there were no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland hai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland Harks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea aboard the Sanna research ship."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie will only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it comes on average just 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a rich 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, shaped by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science, at least from a Greenland-shark, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the biologist guessed for a long time that Greenland haired would become stone."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little knowledge of the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow pace as they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of the Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks still make this prey: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"they may hunt sleepy animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and seek carcasses, which torpedo from higher water layers down."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the deep of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the iron core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks notably had a lot of carbon-14 in the lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"her birth was therefore to lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons hunt more volumes of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lentil core contained a slight surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in contrast, all the larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 watch showed a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that GrÃ¶nland hai-females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland haie with the increase obviously allows for at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methane can live mainly in icy waters is not by chance.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 year old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a sparring."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the city on the Main, therefore, has the best opportunities in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to attract more jobs and companies from London."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Brexit Votum," says Michael VoigtlÃ¤nder, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU."</seg>

<seg id="10">"while in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor VoigtlÃ¤nder. "</seg>

<seg id="16">"in addition, tenants for first-class commercial properties are around 50 percent higher than on the river Main."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyeial-Haigerloch (St. Anna) were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage of Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were met."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time up to the next Romish pilgrimage of all the registrants in the next two years, the St. Anna Council of Ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimages were examined and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy at the Freiburg Cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenhaus, went their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening, Father Stores sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and granted the pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb there was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster Unserer loved wife and so the pilgrim was started from MÃ¼nster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"each day was accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts in the morning and evening."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis made up at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly to sing a song from a specially composed pilgrim song book."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the parish dormitories of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a delicious and strengthening dinner and breakfast."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner spent the last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchorage, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, having only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys's resignation."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tony's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw the potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindu, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner prevailed in qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder was short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, running in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked out from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindi when they got onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and to give me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys page, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no appeal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels with all the UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the bicycle."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kennys, it is possible to repeatedly win Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the case of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I just enjoy this for the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull, qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had contested yesterday with officers before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie won in the world record time in 4: 13,260 in the corresponding women's competition."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a crowd to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April was surrounded by sex and Mobbingvorstrants as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the bicycle, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melts from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus raises all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed by the government's decision at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is expiring in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake."</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects as the smelting consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined the point Henry Schmelz, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smash with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelting process," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the Treaties were" "hedging businesses" "that would have entered into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "said the electricity supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL earnings from the GJ 18 is currently limited by predicting the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that the value of the contracts already depreciated in its annual sludge, amounting to $187 million in" anticipation of termination. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting, or to ensure the supply of electricity to the smelting "is not compromised."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation of why it has been withdrawn from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and a total of 900 megawatts per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and that would not be good for us as a generating set," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan is on the cover of the sought-after September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians-like?), shared reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the universally popular show biz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they all have planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the clichÃ©d story of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a playfield at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly started."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as for Vogue covers (she and her husband Kanye West were to see this in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles a picture band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still went through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, the model "as" models that are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Ms. Jenner, who is described as the" breakthrough model "of her generation, falls under the former category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if it applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the world of fashion has always been tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner criticised her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were too high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the vogue cover.</seg>

<seg id="5">And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we are already offering 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>

<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police are calling witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presumed suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 in the proximity of Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay down in the dark" "in an act of desperation" "on the road and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said these and every witness of the incident instructs to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared with Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown."</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers didn't have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the motorway in the middle of the night, as was said in the newspaper."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have rejected conditions similar to its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also profited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its day-side of the sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously suspected by planet scientists."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans were evaporated and her steam was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen escaped, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star establishments, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack companies - and they are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware Abwehr specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already aiming for ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom salted by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize increasingly on attacks in corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to be pressed falls considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently monitoring a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Klecznski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks was frightening fast over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and erases the originals in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls if a ransomware is added."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German companies affected reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to fully interrupt their business activity, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data once more.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure investigated the use areas and contact with the blackmaders and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they tell their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decode for free for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate roughly and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus supplier Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the existing malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, counseling and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the delivery includes a matching tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaders then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so, one logs in on one of the forts in the underground, buys the set by a criminal and further commissions it to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is per authenticated computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then instruct spammers to spread," declares Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known among many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"in this way, the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in the future, the perpetrators could also face completely new goals on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"on the decon chipper conference, safety researchers demonstrated how to control a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda plans to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and the versatility of a minivans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit surface is slightly different."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l when raised and 1026 l with inverted back rests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like seats, thus providing storage space that is up to 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk is well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he should do his job somewhat more quietly."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the" Executive "top version, the equipment does not leave any wishes unfulfilled."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep far in front of the alarm bells."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-GÃ¼nter WeeÃ, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one sees in the meantime, however, is the insomnia, that is, a disturbance and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"many people feel inadequate to sleep as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disorder is often an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common especially in case of depression," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are subject to one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, let's get an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep problems become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is impaired in the day, visit your doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the CharitÃ© University Medicine Berlin, is hardly available in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"for this reason, one should first contact the doctor in case of sleep problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what's happening?</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the case of snoring with respiratory failure, in case of ill-suffering daily fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cladding, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera is drawn to the ceiling for sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws to fix for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you don't sleep in bed, don't sleep on the day, avoid watching alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it."</seg>

<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, however, article about this" trendy city "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred by burning cars in recent weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor rooms are still occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had spoken several times for the police action against the project, the area referred to as" No-Go Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June, the premises on the ground floor, the carcasses, with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three men on the ground, locked out parts of the road and kept visitors away from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the building workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers removed from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i."</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and nursery schools are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are mainly irritated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the building projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a neighborhood that voiced police protection against vandalizing leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between house occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk."</seg>
<seg id="18">"home occupations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighborhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer StraÃe close to the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under great police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and pollsters from around the world: with them now residents from East Germany and former home occupants share their neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the thrown discs or freshly painted facades, which were carded with color-bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "Left-Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the largest part of the offenses make damage to property, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weighty: people in the 94 are their neighbors, they have not been."</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect architect, her street is not a criminal approach, on the contrary:" here, one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"this is why it was so important for them to get back their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents, such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless newbuildings in former premises, which suppress the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well stocked," "she says."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">"since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group for refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is here, the ice-loving woollen milchee, which has a problem above all."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less mocking than rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write out the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought after."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position satisfied on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon to be found in the WasenstraÃe</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must place the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative district office to the commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work to rely on private apartments, according to Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, congregations have to be consolidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be placed in the WasenstraÃe."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed stay there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be consolidated or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is not" "employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"activity, however, does not only mean labour."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, says Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"thus, here too, administration and volunteers are jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is essential that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"those who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problem cases also, says customer honestly," people with whom nothing is concerned. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call naÃ¯ve." "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely away.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and honorary members must look for activities on site and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they have always in the background that a new impulse could soon come to Urbach as refugees and migrants."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fact, it is unfair to place them on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the archies are already at full capacity to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
