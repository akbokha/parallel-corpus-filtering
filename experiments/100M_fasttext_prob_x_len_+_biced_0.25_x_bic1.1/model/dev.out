Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement expansion and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal struck by Obama about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech , which was classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talked about with Obama , but a meeting had rejected it with reference to Israel &apos;s upcoming election . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told him with a somewhat delicate voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house officers found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ cies Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police captured him .
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to leave for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; Univers@@ it√§ts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
&quot; in spring , he obtained his doc@@ torate in education . &quot;
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
at that time he was the flock of women .
&quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously together for a while .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained and had a daughter , who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both in a summer fair three years ago . &quot;
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ics game in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clean up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American native people and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee . &quot;
&quot; about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght ceremony . &quot;
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial vi@@ gil while the University Choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss in his emergency call as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toy R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal employees as last year but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
&quot; the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the 2014 Christmas season , 45@@ ,000 workers have been hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , Christmas is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and a length of arms away to be with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it is really for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; the greatest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss ur@@ ges once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said to a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the si@@ del@@ ines of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; made this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Survey results show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double dig@@ its , and some start asking seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early during the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain and none of whom won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hes Super PAC@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now see tr@@ umps and start dropping their dollar to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Ac@@ com@@ ination values have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early stages .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac agreement in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with pumping as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of the 10 say they would &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees tr@@ ump temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first state election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality of a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , says ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they put up their schol@@ ar hats , Repub@@ lican voters hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , a multitude of GO@@ P voters will see the Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump picks up almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the spl@@ inter@@ ed field is likely to lead to d@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina he has 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have forgiven their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and nobody can really say never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; but Tr@@ ump is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point of the public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep key His@@ panic Americans off from the Repub@@ lican party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , above all through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the New Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; anno@@ yed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany &quot;
here you can find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea area .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a homeless home will cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; said the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular situations one square meter is the most expensive .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , there is a price such as pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ el has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square footage of di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , noted . &quot;
but well who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich is , as an exception , not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
dual Tor@@ shake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
&quot; a happy hit by Thomas M√ºller , the FC Bayern paved the way to a well earned 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran . &quot;
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympic champion in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90 . + 2 ) and G√∂tz@@ fri@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth race success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally win the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third round . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th birthday in the Champions League , M√ºller was supported by Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a shot of the World Champion as a Flan@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised fans of the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before the game in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich audience kept the word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his last six home games in the King &apos;s class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled over here . &quot;
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often with their aggressive efforts to work without in@@ scrut@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were initiated too often by shifting the game on left @-@ right Douglas Costa , who rarely went through O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
M√ºller had more luck from right when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Der St√ºr@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ed with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians were playing domin@@ antly , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to make con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; on Tor@@ guard Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was a legacy . &quot;
&quot; for instance , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a chain of four chains with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario G√∂t@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat outside . &quot;
&quot; after finishing the final training , the World Cup hero gave the green light after finishing the final training , &quot; said Sports chairman Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; G√∂t@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ m M√ºller added another . &quot;
before the game it had come to Kra@@ j@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly per@@ mut@@ tered Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block were obviously provoked by the fans of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bavarian fan was injured in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - that is suggest@@ ing a long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : with ren@@ unciation the risk drops rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ der . &quot;
the scientists had observed over 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly inflamm@@ ations in smokers . &quot;
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk however within a short period of time , write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; it could , however , take over ten years before the endanger@@ ment to the level of non @-@ smoking sin@@ ks , explained Er@@ du@@ ret Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; a Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E said : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health right down to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years has been affected by lack of denti@@ stry , divided the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists rep@@ el at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from the late Anti@@ quity .
archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; close to the construction site for the new Rh@@ en@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
historians have been searching for so @-@ called bottom monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as an expert for archae@@ ology and soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction stage of the bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now found it . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church had stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; beside the ruins of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman of freight tra@@ cked
&quot; after a young woman is unhappy at the station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ er@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern &quot; &quot; station , the Federal Police asks the people to help . &quot;
&quot; arriving early on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ pm , the woman moved from direction to the station building at the end of the platform , and was captured by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , she had he@@ avi@@ est injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;

European Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; for the stri@@ pping of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private mediation facility for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de plans to bring the European negotiating position to the free trade talks with the US as a European negotiating position .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to be created with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; in concrete terms , the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they are to come from the same parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries . &quot;
a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; until now , the parties involved agreed with each other to arbit@@ ration judges , but there was no objection to their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work on an international investment court according to its own data . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are being critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary to allow tax pa@@ yers to enter into national laws , or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ a@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic secretary , Matthias M@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans as a major advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economies of the economy by too much new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States up to now . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dating folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells of various places he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs tell . &quot;
where they were born and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can be dri@@ fted at any time into great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or arises , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a ver@@ itable series : each of the 50 states in the US should be discussed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is a widely celebrated masterpiece . &quot;
ingeni@@ ous ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not in any season list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic offset . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; from the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on bands and big fluorescent stage d√©@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; plate in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; until one en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bly expresses himself , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally turns out with thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ n &apos;s debut is anticipated at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming session with tension &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming session and for the first time set up with David Cameron . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions briefly and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has provoked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several story stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ bish@@ op@@ √¢ s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; is that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is a T@@ ory leader over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another political article , says that he has &quot; crow@@ ed @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented by the Shadow of Business Minister if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he has also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub@@ house , to discuss the issue . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionna@@ ires with the Prime Minister were regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would need far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid goal SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period in the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and best estimate since 2009 over the time of an interest increase .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared with the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of Riv@@ ale AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competi@@ tor group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares increased 5 % after the mining company said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a sale of stock as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his assessment of the rating on &quot; sale . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports said higher wages would je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ yel@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber in the capital : on the Bi@@ eber expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the pupp@@ y is 21 years young , a hanging with the Upper Austrian fr@@ inge . &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
rather even more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation U@@ 17 is spinning .
as Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 year old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber &quot; &quot; building : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang on in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her M@@ um E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if ever .
&quot; she says : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the grammar school . &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her dream , &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who it@@ ches it ?
the fans do not .
even Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has taken care of anyway .
&quot; for the advertising break of the super@@ sti@@ tion he cas@@ u@@ ded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le firm flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber is drinking a coffee , one mar@@ vels at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million people in this way .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on 1st place .
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da @-@ Poster takes Lebanese on the idea of Pot@@ ato &apos;s idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
&quot; both are both - in the potato d@@ √∂n@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ denburg snack owners Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer has been turning in his store , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the idea was to have the Lebanese entered into the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer has . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot;
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Ground Com@@ ple@@ tion Camp@@ a@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ come
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell endor@@ sed tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment le@@ verages its annual Investor @-@ Strategy day . &quot;
&quot; much is at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA outlets and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to some 14 percent in eastern countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million annual revenues per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will be opening 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business , and in the amount of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s high fixed cost base , could cost some 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Met@@ cash gains market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s revenue in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s food and food trade , which have supplied about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction while printing revenues and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve their stores with fast growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label foodstuffs . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programmes are to be developed to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to earnings in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ aki is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ i and ear@@ ns in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than cri@@ tique of his own behavior .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the in@@ famous discourse of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice through the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I was supposed to beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he finally saw him beating a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty brave about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a thu@@ g in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ gios in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent fix@@ ture to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he rises in the eyes of the public , and he has made some aw@@ ful mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives , but we try to assist him with the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency situation and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who were trying to get illegal into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants concentrated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials responded with indignation .
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip along the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some were re@@ trac@@ ted from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels couldn &apos;t agree a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a quick action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency situation , which was rec@@ alled on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became an entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or hur@@ ting the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government states the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; in the morning , Hungarian officials also included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd of people to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to get there , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s promin@@ ence hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant to their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a huge margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; her support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters aged 50 and over has been volati@@ li@@ zed and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; in the past month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections state that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it &apos;s time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to deal with the problems and choice of voters is also cited .
&quot; as the vice president has potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the prim@@ aries who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage rises in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the past month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate elections is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates generate good results with some important features in the elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister continues to be questioned , most Democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions did not affect their overall opinion . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said their opinion was even worse . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters in the country see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good lead notes . &quot;
&quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do best cut off hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; in the meantime , the two candidates don &apos;t need half the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Repub@@ lican voters continue to support Tr@@ ump nationwide , with support growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son declined from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among Repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is increasing in the poll@@ s - he ends up with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find still warm water . &quot;
a dip in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , beach temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College Neul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a ch@@ ic@@ ane ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound bag full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move across a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , then the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and calling Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , Poli@@ z@@ ef Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started to hide and set aside the welfare of the Brotherhood through the words of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ fik Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with dul@@ ler force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ a &apos;s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of frau@@ dul@@ ent attacks and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest rates are coming , and the hous@@ eholder gets bank@@ rupt , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a little guidance on the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole fuss was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that net income taxes will be stran@@ gled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , rather flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gies at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ den@@ zi@@ ell will occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not happen before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few anticipate that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to data from the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants picked up the F@@ ed interest rate year round , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might approve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading accounts for a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all up@@ take cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ recession heights were put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipated an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the loan portfolio fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in the return of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse because an increasing dollar bill makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet total exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the 1994 , 1999 and 2004 rate increases . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt become a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers can see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice and said that it was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , claiming a leading MP and raising new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ law radio station was &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like using the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC Director General pointed out the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and assign@@ ing new works is really important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder was needed to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in special BBC mode .
he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; if the next time it was a series of entertainment .
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money on roy@@ alties for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 &quot;
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping mall dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; the total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases from this event , held last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers rolled around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites fell off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that ¬£ 5 expenditure was spent a little over ¬£ 1 online .
&quot; for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed , as a crane in Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand mo@@ at collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to pay their respect when the first of the dead took their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ vic gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession was passing by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane was top@@ pled by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the praying ends . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King hangs over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family for the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction suspended . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 victims , who were killed when a crane was top@@ pled by the Great Central Menshevi@@ ks Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was supported . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who continue to go to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company would be banned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was sum@@ mon@@ ed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the grand mo@@ sch@@ y , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch who takes place later this month . &quot;
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ y as part of the massive construction project led by the bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials arranged that 1 million ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .

&quot; it is said that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled ost@@ European arti@@ sans , who carry out the work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you can handle walls skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; for Br@@ its employ more and more professional tra@@ des@@ people to make DIY jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has become obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that address tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are being hit by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we need to shift this more strongly to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
&quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher announced a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group owed the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vice @-@ Master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and off@@ ence on Wednesday . &quot;
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with office abuse .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that in 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used funds from club accounts to which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; in the case of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point in time an asset had ar@@ isen . &quot;
&quot; sports officials would only have charged allowance compens@@ ations and the sports club , for whom they had invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bre@@ w @-@ office of the financial authorities . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; in the case of corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the allowance compens@@ ations has been agreed retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; for this reason Pau@@ schal@@ - and non @-@ detailed bookings , as well as the former chairman , explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and pass@@ books were administered by the two defend@@ ants , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als had not been disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial services , important is only the debt relief , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; when investigations began in 2011 against the one official investigation for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and was not known to the association according to its statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said he had believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; claim re@@ dress &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know . &quot;
the first defend@@ ant stated that he had not agreed with this formula because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he only counted mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he added EUR 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
the accused could not show precise documentation for the early years .
&quot; after an operation test , in which everything was judged to be correct , they were no longer kept , they declared . &quot;
the second defend@@ ant also referred to mil@@ eage .
&quot; all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , and he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he declared in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ akes another 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; in addition to the reduction in personnel cuts for the past three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ √®re will continue to build further jobs when the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up . &quot;
there is no end to the sub@@ missions of the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) computer .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US Technology Group plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs tot@@ alling EUR 2.7 billion ( ‚Ç¨ 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special load of around ‚Ç¨ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has become a company with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently divided into : this is how the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services replaced the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer in Lenovo .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive shifts in shifts in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company , headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man , re@@ acted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and increasingly doing business online . &quot;
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans stipul@@ ate the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would predominantly push for rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
&quot; in contrast , 24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad would reject 51 per cent of the respon@@ dents , 20 per cent would be responsible . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .

R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed to the Serbian border at R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ ger@@ as and water @-@ lights against several hundreds of abandoned refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind them a police line had formed and a water @-@ light stood behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially employed pe@@ pper@@ mint .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
many tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; in this way , the group was dissolved . &quot;
the refugees have now withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who had breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the Federal Reserve Bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , last week &apos;s view , was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a little longer and that the interest rates will last from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced by 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday
mort@@ gage at Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it un@@ happ@@ ier &quot; , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
and he said he shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be upset . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; looking at the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , saying , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; Univers@@ it√§ts @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , officials said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who declared that they were married for about seven years , was described as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate degree from the Delta State University , as his life law gives on the university &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this surely demands its toll .
eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and inv@@ ali@@ dates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the company &apos;s goal of real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business in future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the Management Board , Managing Director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airline operates under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the courts . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the resting regime for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a predicted record score , &quot; Cockpit &quot; wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept is in the background . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa puts out routes to the Group @-@ owned equity line of Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left outside defender to weeping and closing it out for at least six months of playing , Louis Van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
it will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an elite meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back stronger . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in case of defeat at PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad violation . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad violation , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a throw from Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to take Dr. Se@@ uss published in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything is nice and good , except that the following paragraph , which Cameron is supposed to describe the act of the book , reflects an abstra@@ ction of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by reading her desire to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s crew but it is still difficult
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not rule out an ou@@ tri@@ ght victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ cre@@ tes from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ eers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination as - and I said this - players their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago the barrel of Ly@@ th would have been prolonged , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss commen@@ ded his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first entered Jonathan de@@ fi@@ antly in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance lies now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I treasure highly . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early during this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make mos@@ ques apart from Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed drummer has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s bucket of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ que did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as op@@ ener .
he made three hundred runs strai@@ gh@@ ta@@ way and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ards who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the training staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played in all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
&quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour , bringing energy and a powerful effort into the setup . &quot;

the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could gain allow@@ ances if the economy falls into a dol@@ drums by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ expressed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which broke up sharply on Tuesday because of Europe . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on their own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes which they usually do not want , are full . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed up for summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , then come home and say they have allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who looks for Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; Berlin says - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exc@@ essively long endurance races such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain one left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg to help the British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; that is why some such ministers may even plan on intentionally not helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press microphones , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ins@@ anity , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ro@@ gue , telephone @-@ chi@@ pping ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Tony Bla@@ ir was actually thinking about her , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly tap on his back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste any more time for me - appears in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I am welcoming it in a friendly way - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ lage @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wild feelings of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary called &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ legitimate to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his Cab@@ inet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos; fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor did J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and de@@ pu@@ ties according to all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep label support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ bish@@ op@@ ric &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ung economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined in Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Basic report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month touched on the &quot; &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; on which p@@ he justified his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ s@@ Health , whose directors previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from tobacco companies Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are included , some of which also provide sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco bat@@ on was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; stands out clearly &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted earlier . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative risks compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ on , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be viewed by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ fought time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
&quot; after the BBC Director General Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I consider medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least do its production on programs that others do not make or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as wide as possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I try to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews due to the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts return what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart teaching in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ enders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs &quot; to go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can argue if they &apos;re going to justify their sacred missions to justify 4 billion radio roy@@ alties , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can obtain the best value from this .
&quot; of course you all think , we all think that one gets a great value for ¬£ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for ¬£ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its thi@@ an mission to &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain an example on public television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos; Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment when they are sounding with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; th@@ read@@ worms are usually not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels , and can be found in the membranes of some of the worm cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves activate the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells , which they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ az@@ ani modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence ranges from slightly annoying up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to talk : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ana , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those you would not talk to , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often transform themselves into beverage recipes , movie night event locations , and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are dressed and put on their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to : do not remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted persons receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship rule by che@@ eks .
&quot; since you start the university at the high point of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; bad mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when they kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check this out with the dairy owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to handle more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to their milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise which keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors whether it was a matter of making Drum &amp; Bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same residence hall random@@ ly ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ ys@@ mal aw@@ k@@ ward if you keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , dis@@ connect and see her every day and perhaps witness how she treats all the common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to give your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; holiday homes for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners &quot;
&quot; the real estate entrepreneur , Markus Gil@@ dner , builds complex terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money . &quot;
&quot; for example for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only mother and the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gu@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here for a great part .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need enough living space in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : I have done my project correctly , legally . &quot;
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ stated who , in a terra@@ ced house , creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
there is only a lack of space in the cities .
refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even everyday people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only mother or the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap on &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message that tells you that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the rush passes or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; when the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to continue because the phone may turn off half@@ way and this could lead to a dis@@ continuation of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg , in battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , knows only one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the start , the World Cup runner under@@ lined the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion from the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won already seven of the twelve races so far and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite in the race .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; for days , a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is possible to record chess players who cannot impose the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; red @-@ white &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town is seen .
qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ b√ºro looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ ative Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation &apos;s clo@@ ak and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; apart from consultations , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation runs it down from the mountain into the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ looking information from now on will receive information on questions such as care insurance or the benefits of health care and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently many benefits of the insurance companies are not taken into account , because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the B√ºrger@@ hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure essential in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also devoted itself to the club meeting at age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able con@@ vivi@@ ality . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that senior citizens can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 noon . &quot;

&quot; now it is official : after renov@@ ating at the Fu@@ ch@@ spark@@ Stadium the date for the game FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg against the Third Party of W√ºrzburg has not been fixed yet , now the 6th October was set as an appointment . &quot;
the meeting of FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg in the eighth @-@ final of the Bavarian soccer Tot@@ op@@ ok@@ als against the third @-@ party FC Wu@@ erz@@ burger Ki@@ ckers has now been fin@@ alised .
&quot; played on Tuesday , 6 October at 19 : 00 in the Bam@@ berg Fu@@ ch@@ spark@@ Stadium . &quot;
&quot; we are glad that we now know when the game goes on stage , now we have planning certainty , &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z H√º@@ mmer , who also points to the sale of tickets now started . &quot;
&quot; for our team , it is something special to play against a third party . &quot;
&quot; therefore we hope for a lot of spectators , and this is not without reason , as floo@@ d@@ light games have a special appeal . &quot;
&quot; in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg attracted 1 FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Regional Alliance 1st FC Schwein@@ furt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) . &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the K√ºnstler@@ haus best@@ owed an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was said in the letter of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian theatre museum . &quot;

according to his own statement 30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have put in the last two years .
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , however , he did not admit it . &quot;
&quot; in the inner city of Bremen , he had just cut his hair when he saw a parking space guard standing outside for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; after that , the meadow r@@ ushed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer and threw her the counter@@ f@@ eit financial penalty in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
only afterwards I decide whether the meadow will be displayed or not .

men beat a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young people , and struck him with the fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a break of the nose and ble@@ eds strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the temple , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their apartment and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; there , he was attacked again by the m@@ allet and another male figure . &quot;
&quot; with the help of a stick , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be hosp@@ ital@@ ised for medical care .
&quot; up to now , there is only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second rac@@ quet should have been around 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was clothed with a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and refer@@ ers to report on the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot;
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ offs .
&quot; also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs &apos;s mayor , Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand has luck : there , Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ aus reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich faces his successor in half a place in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller re@@ opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met years ago Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ ole , who are currently completing their vocational training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to get into practice during the next year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ eper and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the idea to pursue his own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf was pleased by the couple M√ºller .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees himself being his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so they agreed , the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice . &quot;
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank M√ºller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief medical doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz Group and volunte@@ ered in the DRC @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ aus works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ alist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the M√ºll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , wish to settle down as a family physician . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the IT system is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 Euros will be given as part of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ Sharing Lord Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , some 2,000 patients arrive in the field of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen every quarter , according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found herself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits M√ºll@@ ers &apos;s talk , also looks at familiar faces : take over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel rim re@@ members smiling . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she already felt a little melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the dormit@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds , &quot; We have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far I have always been pressed against gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also being driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said inner minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum is also &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is at the forefront .
&quot; but it is clear that there is a need for clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow the refugees to travel to Austria and Germany , and possibly establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Home Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not look like that . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not planning to reduce its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; pointed out Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to pass in the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick it up in the near cor@@ n@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving in T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; these are mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in operation .
&quot; in the coming days his country will be reck@@ oning with around 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , and reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to suggest people to take specific routes : &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria &quot;
the passengers were all night away from the approximately 500 kilometers away Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the previous postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country had prepared similar plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed a good report to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to move on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning in a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high rate of refugees at this time .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hung@@ arians have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the border region 20 years after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of having gained insights into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ eer and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; states the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trial against 32 more defend@@ ants in the case lasted .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are to have acted both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their err@@ ands , partly fast step@@ per , partly cozy ram@@ bling . &quot;
you control the two stations of the Mannheim Auto Salon at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sunlight and in the middle four large panels each with the heading &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to ... &quot;
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce brought attention to her 20th anniversary with this promotion and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ant spontaneously attacks the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; affir@@ m &quot; &quot; the sentence &quot; &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; don &apos;t suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only if I make it clear to me that sometime the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , according to the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people . &quot;

the funeral and funeral service is one of the honorary employees of the first hour .
&quot; confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was looking for volunteers , she immediately reported to her and had been there when it was founded in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as further education and supervision of the funeral and funeral services .
training sessions for new employees are offered every two years .
&quot; the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; there , too , further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ land transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. predicted a gain between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts were expecting $ 10.@@ 84 . &quot;
&quot; despite higher price increases , the average view is 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher impacts on body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; solid earnings , &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation employment were announced a day later as the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was earning $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s questioned analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has experienced a decline in the international priority shipment , which resulted in sales in its unit Express shipping for stagn@@ ating . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , turnover in bo@@ d@@ land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings fell due to higher operating costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ oming over them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story seat hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the presi@@ ding judge Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , recent turbul@@ ence on global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious representatives afraid to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal government bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do which makes itself unsure of itself to the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets however expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy uph@@ eld the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would so@@ ot@@ he financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good roads to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world put together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors argued that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would push global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market recovered slightly , and the Dow is now almost 10 % lower than May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation as to when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had failed in the last few weeks , they would put on re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US National Bank . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere mention of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only super@@ v@@ ise developments elsewhere but also consult other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; varn@@ ishing , per@@ tin@@ ent member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to raising interest , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite a limited noticeable effect on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate fut@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest rates because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should advance the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home on D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other classes is different than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . it does this by presenting pictures of babies that are painted on breasts which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro gym@@ nasi@@ um .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited renovation of the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport area are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was approved unanim@@ ously without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to this , the committee decided , among other things , an application for a construction @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid cultivation plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; this means that a &quot; &quot; gab@@ led roof &quot; &quot; should be constructed with a first and roof @-@ roof@@ ed roof . &quot;
&quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again about the a@@ version of the roof , which for energy reasons - differently than in the cultivation schedule - should lie below 10 degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan per@@ tains not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; in terms of bad@@ ness - and the Bern@@ ese community is usually more restric@@ tive when it comes to liberation moti@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project for bo@@ ating hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent for this , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are estimated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
&quot; in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the administration office for testing . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ on@@ gau Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the staff are moved from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; these are seeing the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the tra@@ itor Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ on@@ gau with fishermen and the further existing interior .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who do not have access to Sch@@ on@@ gau will be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner White . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play on the question of who to succeed him , who agreed to take over the lead from October 1st and change his team to Sch@@ on@@ gau . &quot;
&quot; in every case , for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this means an &quot; upgrade &quot; and an extension of the offer in the area of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county was planning to do this for 2018 , when the ongoing refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü &apos;s coun@@ cill@@ or , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , will be used as accommodation for asylum applications in the future . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü was unable to say that there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ a psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; says Fischer of the quasi @-@ move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as head physician for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in recent decades hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened with closure , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are challenged tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) with Berg@@ ische HC .
&quot; although the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener in the Bh@@ c claimed a painful defeat and made a good fortune there . &quot;
hunt with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the meeting on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police informed . &quot;
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were put into hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the criminal police were determined .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of crimes of violence
&quot; a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who had been missing since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a rock in rock enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to violence .
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested also on Tuesday evening , according to the fact , was admitted and the investig@@ ator led to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing persons , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrest was reported to the authorities in the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought forward on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put an end to him . &quot;
the further investigations are to be carried out on the closer circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gaps
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a paid place .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
distribution agreements on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers coming from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the Association of Social housing associations . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing amounts of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the residential construction policy of the past few years .
Germany is shooting down an apartment deficit which is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study , already lack@@ ed 77@@ 0.000 living units in the metrop@@ olitan areas . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many professionals lived in large cities in emergency rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed on the housing market invol@@ un@@ tarily because of the dol@@ drums in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be dispens@@ ed with , and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received in towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , at 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available 300 million Euros had been rec@@ alled on Monday evening . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia turn a corridor
&quot; after Hungary , practically no passing is possible , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing to grant the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but nevertheless the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot;
&quot; after the disman@@ tling of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
&quot; on the eve of the day , Hungary closed its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new laws that came into force on the same day are virtually unnecessary in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived both by bus and with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to get to Croatia on foot over the green border . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach the border fence . &quot;
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 disabled people . &quot;
shortly before Tor@@ tage on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prec@@ lu@@ de the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted are threatened with prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; tran@@ sit@@ ons &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important Tran@@ sition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants were 13 families with small children , as well as two older people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has any prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian standards , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
workers begin to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
scrap skel@@ et@@ ons were broken down and one of the host camps in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants remained in the country , according to government figures . &quot;
about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we first had the unexpected guests cal@@ med , with snacks and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said right , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N discussion . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u . after the announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , it was still crossing the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Br√º@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a double brid@@ le sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n has now sent tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly and publicly tra@@ iled the attitude of the Hungarian government into the realm of national socialism . &quot;
the speakers of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for people seeking protection . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ strong quarters &quot;
&quot; with the suppression of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; in the wake of the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen first @-@ floor centre , Konrad has already got a grip on . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great fuss , &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; master &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 qu@@ arti@@ s in the last year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the govern@@ ors , he has already held talks . &quot;
these would have assured him not to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , to be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations even in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that quarters have to keep a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the tops . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; must apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful with the accommodation , he reas@@ oned with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further notice to the un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er are not responsible for the Republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees at three to four .
&quot; up to now , our own research has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands better distribution
for the time being no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
the Mayor presi@@ ded over the partition of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday announced further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available . &quot;
&quot; the protection @-@ seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from other EU member states , P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ √º@@ hr@@ inger , the fact that Austria is now taking control again at its borders is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial area is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Shi@@ py@@ ard and later on to acquire some of them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; from S &amp; T ‚Ç¨ 1.7 million were invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meter floor space in the building is already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
&quot; the 49 year old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ ar@@ cade had to push this project , after all , it has now gotten gains in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz area that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I am most happy when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman cannot answer with the ultimate certainty . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether he expresses himself to x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge in international crisis politics - the candidate for the U.S. presi@@ dency quick@@ ens the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire deri@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker , with the liqu@@ or hair@@ style , is known for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine road . &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village is related to it via -@@ zig places .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the city rider Sim@@ one Wen@@ del sp@@ un a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt kind , &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native town of K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump as well as the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - so with the statement that he would be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , I also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit of a major mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in High German : the investors , she says . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , therefore , comes from the village of the don@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the United States . &quot;
real estate transactions in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate company .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long term , failed on the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because once he had been cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes distinctive statements of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ishes , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a native tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American more distant , &quot; he is always so generous . &quot; &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension mist@@ ress Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions just how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ during a visit , which was generally well @-@ ank@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t be imagined by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; you find it better if he doesn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the US the interest is awakening . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain auction village .
&quot; the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to assume the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in the ratings for Today . &quot;
the breakfast show from N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the Board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise generated an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , with today more than 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , today a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August Today more than 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 went off . &quot;
&quot; up to now , Sun@@ rise stands at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators with Today at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 viewers . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently v@@ owed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ten Star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new Quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia made 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.@@ m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery un@@ v@@ eils secrets ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
the woman who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor was envel@@ oped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally added a hint to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood was the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a cor@@ rup@@ ter who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both soon - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle have shown great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams looking for their impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have f@@ aded Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ gle so it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ dn publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his late catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for for his N@@ FL &apos;s debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens once , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut at the time in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; for the high amounts of refugees , the Free elec@@ tors call for the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn her@@ on in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis in Bavarian schools when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get ven@@ ge@@ ance in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the State Parliament faction of the Free elec@@ tors conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian municipality .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free elec@@ torate .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going any further , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the Free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need national uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more man@@ a@@ geable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy should not fall under the table in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt .
a long @-@ standing fan remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; middle level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools , with an extension of the secondary school secondary school from three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums they want .
free drive at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
tigh@@ tened Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits after a wide range of direction @-@ less and nervous business developments .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a stronger pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges ensured a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x rose by 1.9 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 , as the lead in the euro@@ zone , declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid gains were also boo@@ sted by the London and Paris business places .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index ranked roughly 1 percent in the plus segment . &quot;
&quot; many stock exchanges expect the markets to be replaced by the US , even after the interest decision in the US , and also for the big decline in the date stock on this Friday . &quot;
&quot; the debate about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , and also left deep traces on E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies are likely to lack ‚Ç¨ 30 billion in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately always lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x summit .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors provided little attention to the German chip@@ maker at this time . &quot;
investment in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold than in the previous year , as the AC@@ EA industry association announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the documents of Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.9 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , return on listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
the Swiss pension index Rex rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Federal Government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro dropped to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 US dollars in the afternoon .
&quot; towards noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to $ 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police fired rubber stories into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ stret@@ i , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rec@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled central for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the trial after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ de Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City plans to market an area of about 4000 square metres in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; the plan is to use the area for a mix of trade , trade and living . &quot;
&quot; wait for appropriate offers , it means by the city . &quot;
which investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner Gro√üe Stra√üe , bought already a few months ago and the building was torn down on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ gli@@ ders are still concerned - they fear selling their leisure facilities
&quot; months had passed behind closed doors , greeted , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den lie on the table .
&quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
originally this point stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on the offensive from System Construction Management : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea bu@@ d owner and board member in the interests of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ d that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears a number of other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; whole bus loads must come so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what happens on the well @-@ hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ comprehen@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they are fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusual personal approach to announ@@ cing the call for donations on its blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark web and bus far@@ es , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / Tri@@ er@@ eli@@ ef will be doubled to 11 million dollars .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I , which underwent this operation , decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained for those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition decreased completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes fully dissolved in only one percent and in part with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , says leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight in comparison with the gastro@@ enter@@ oco@@ que group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people undergoing an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
&quot; it is a topic that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets after years the s@@ warm of her youth , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , who swallow strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of recei@@ pts of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison@@ ous control centres report , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are coming more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them arrive in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some kids pur@@ pos@@ efully drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media . &quot;
YouTube videos show how young dis@@ infection agents only drink because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly mixed dis@@ infection products with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children . &quot;
hand dis@@ infection agents contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; very few sp@@ lashes of alcohol pois@@ oning , especially for small children , can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ in center at the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the caster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people let these hand dis@@ infection products reach out within reach of children , and when children get there , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry , fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold of being drunk by an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ur@@ ped her words , and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room . &quot;
&quot; doctors watched her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and had ki@@ cked her head , &quot; &quot; said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths via alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which was noted as a drug . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ eine &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their space .
&quot; the police looked at the ver@@ ted plan as a &quot; &quot; ul@@ cer &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in the event of a rear @-@ end collision on the trans@@ verse sp@@ liers between Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was slightly injured in the event of a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the trans@@ verse sp@@ liers in the direction of a round@@ about industrial area and it was too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta that stood before . &quot;
&quot; in the accident involved vehicles , property damage was about 10,000 euros , divided by the police . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ours about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was spontaneously denied by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football isn &apos;t boring Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers central fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an am@@ bass@@ adors for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swear by Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic will fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed by five points ahead of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it exactly this way - but we must go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
coming together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases overall in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures in the National Statisti@@ cs Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland decreased by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland , David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I Will Be Wat@@ ching a Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available than places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; could have better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ asing persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he handed over the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer attempting to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a house of peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Ben c@@ ous@@ ins , a football player , offers an unforgettable example . &quot;
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards have tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
&quot; Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t tu@@ g test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had been kept back for 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age charges and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - whom I am going to mention when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely believe in their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should this be my opinion that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps make people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there think I &apos;m there .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and cast me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is now considering them . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer were built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg .
it could have been the same yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been the whole day , which was the case yesterday . &quot;
it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police found himself in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver flight and lowered assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy Stri@@ kes Against Ri@@ vals for Cla@@ ims on Ring@@ ing Fi@@ ghts
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying Final in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scarcely concealed comment to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ly of his team and said that at Tac@@ kl@@ ing , they were focused only on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team was confident , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this shows up again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring competitions , when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock to him . &quot;
it is funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a divorce place . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you &apos;d like to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to big games .
&quot; Bell@@ amy , too , pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks do and do not score any points ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will encounter them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team released this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the semi@@ final at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit after drug store &quot;
&quot; a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life sentence because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a b@@ ail of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he attempted to possess the whole amount and that in the caf√© could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of flight to Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal cause , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
&quot; at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver notic@@ ing it too late , trying in vain to switch to the left at the last moment , as the police announced . &quot;
the crash culp@@ tor &apos;s cab ri@@ pped apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as this fell asleep and logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent images sent by children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the confused reports and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care and saw the five images , then analysed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; then Ho@@ gg tended to say to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches on the computer were done by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; on 25 January of this year , Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to bre@@ aching in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year and not to appear before the court hear@@ ings on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; should be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the judgement until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit , but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other cases still pending . &quot;
he was taken before the date of the sentence into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers suffered from fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the county of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot through bridges and ri@@ fl@@ es to the German side .
&quot; there , they are received by the Federal Police and for@@ warded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; compared to the start of the week on Wednesday , more refugees arrived at Munich &apos;s main railway station in comparison to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm birds in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart divided . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see circle with sheets of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot;
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IA@@ A .
&quot; in 2015 , there is a growing trend in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 per cent of new regi@@ strations fell to this segment by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( publication date 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , a number of new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel offers an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view , starting at 17@@ 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is just five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A for new compact cars ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival M√©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a fifth door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year he comes to trade , and then as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is perfectly integrated into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in the offer , however , a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available . &quot;
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will start in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand on the front panel : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was especially moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison sentence Te@@ gel who was housed in a small cell for months .
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
that was the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision that was published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined within only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s information , was now on his free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warrant had failed because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin .
&quot; however , the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and re@@ proved the case for re @-@ trial . &quot;
they see the human dignity of the man wounded .
court Court decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of liability for repar@@ ations were decisive for legal reasons , a compensation claim was given , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a mer@@ ing@@ ling of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of compensation .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; it was only in April that they said to a prisoner of damages , because he was confined naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a single cell without a separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; for this reason prisoners are always locked up for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ ckets it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Minister of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young talent , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that .
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to different progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and indeed for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it was built so far ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing , however , is dramatic above all with affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing per year are taken out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable homes will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; not much is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created , and the federal government would have to invest an amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and Federal Construction Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , says Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; labour is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the state society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ researcher Dietrich Rei@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on labour for asylum seekers of up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as residence duty to asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the viewpoint has mostly prevailed that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster . &quot;
lack of knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
&quot; up to now , there is still no adequate supply of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the building of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees fle@@ dged their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated to be ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important for the de@@ wor@@ ded parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eln , spokes@@ man for the youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased greatly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German are prepared in welcome classes on the lessons . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ones from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception so far was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position . &quot;
&quot; if refugees are willing to study , access to the university could be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or toler@@ ation do not receive benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law , if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive a B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of legitimate people . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible , as of 1 January 2016 , this span was shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ being &apos;s right to develop a new state religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association which takes care of newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
rights belong also to duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; on Thursday , the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be a topic of the whole society more than today . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination policy and a general equality law for a decade .
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time , and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany require , must become reality in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far , writes Medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system for this . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards right away . &quot;
services rendered could later be rep@@ lic@@ ated with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , doctors mainly do the language barrier to create . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpreting costs would need to be taken over . &quot;
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and in young people it is about HIV enligh@@ tenment . &quot;
&quot; with the partially different clinical pictures German doctors come from their training , however , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some of them even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly pass tests again . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ k . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is a trau@@ mati@@ sed person in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four per cent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices may apply for a psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , veter@@ an dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to the arena on a brick and wash your dreams .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior boss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the Circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
so the gift for the discern@@ ing family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot;
&quot; cocktail @-@ Cocktail with a cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; says managing director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family catches the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; besides numerous salmon streams , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a sense of touch and joint . &quot;
balancing with the wheel on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ uses in the attitude of circus animals are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing good either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , can be read from the eyes according to possibility . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
&quot; so , the top commandment : good for the animals . &quot;
&quot; special to her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst says . &quot;
&quot; zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the circus , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to your performances from September 17 to 20 , at 5 pm and 8 pm . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal zoo is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds the wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations made by de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had prof@@ ited him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ z@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , which they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the concerned Parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will split up later this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; expected job cuts will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , according to HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s explanation . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring process in order to tackle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional computers to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the prepar@@ atory season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the injuries . &quot;
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it , a little break @-@ in , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League Cap@@ it@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far hope to lead the club to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Fest : the comedy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication led through social media , with emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominant . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ cally values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beautiful thing about friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing , I explained : ... &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all the 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after he hit Malm@@ √∂ .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , he meets PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ √∂ . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but after that , they missed a series of opportunities before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Transpar@@ ent Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back at ease , even if there are certain things we still need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend held a 2 : 2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing storm was described as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ √∂ , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field lined up a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the offensive . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared , with some mal@@ functions and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who p@@ aired with no less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then abandoned after he had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored its sixth goal after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers 2.5 billion dollars through stock sales
&quot; mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday by selling stock as part of its huge educational plan . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about EUR 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn p@@ ushes the demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of rights rights brought a rapid increase to the tip of the London stock exchange trading on trading on early Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;

the White House Con@@ fir@@ med Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings Vis@@ its in Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and rep@@ lies President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago , just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times poker winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he already stood before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how to run Bay@@ erns play time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s victory triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown failed to emphas@@ ise the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the filling of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te , beaten by her white stock@@ holder . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ er White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded before approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on about the only black person in space so he can explain its diversity - that is SO K@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the we@@ et earned more than 5,000 retail we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; record still matter , ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , Le@@ aders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned maiden champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cinem@@ at@@ ographer Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish in the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds faster , which made him a winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the big prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Britain , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season ; the filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word , which was so hard to believe over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad For@@ mus . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held up his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings and then once again in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings 6 times and allowed three cracks .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to get very concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit song by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the whi@@ p well , &quot; &quot; Ex@@ us said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better off at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back@@ round at the end of the seventh session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game again . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right field@@ of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon made his second ba@@ z@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier a stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man to face with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who got the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run rift . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the major league in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ghts hit a Double Play
&quot; after Detroit , at the end of the ninth interior , added a guy &apos;s insurance run , wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don , scor@@ ing the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , stem@@ med from S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the game , Detroit prof@@ ited from a non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the vulner@@ ability list before the game after he had been missing for more than a month due to a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I was releasing and feeling that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , flus@@ hes handed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z put Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ner in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
note : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z died due to a violation of the throw school .
&quot; he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris will be deleted from the vulner@@ ability list in order to fight against T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 &quot;
he has been missing in the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin san@@ vin san@@ vin ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who are born in Wiesbaden will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden will tell on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted between 450 and 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; over the past ten days , according to the government presi@@ ding responsible for the first recording , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the deliber@@ ate reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective action . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington has also called for a massive surge of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controlled at Southern and Eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany too did not send any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement on which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees crossed the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , and Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection , too . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view has been strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort of strength . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania will be blocked with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , as witnessed by e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants found their way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Saturn En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice tail of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean sw@@ aps .
these are researchers from observations of Raum@@ Zeit@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this de@@ af@@ ness movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
longer has been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , closed the astronom@@ ers at that time . &quot;
&quot; the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 M√ºnchen several weeks
1860 M√ºnchen must abandon Val@@ erie R@@ ama for about one month .
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; probably four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ald loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an uni@@ mag@@ inable professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was previously under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; the possibility to prove its ability . &quot;
&quot; after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ √§ger Ru@@ by Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should go into running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent collision at the head .
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious sh@@ ot@@ gun . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
&quot; because man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : B vitamins are contained in them as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when purchasing , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell . &quot;
the peel colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can also taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chi@@ cor@@ ee and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the US parcel service U@@ PS produces up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA . &quot;
&quot; the company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers , and announced U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
drivers are looking for drivers .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS has increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have used previous precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , late deliveries delayed the parcel service to harsh critic@@ isms . &quot;
&quot; first sight @-@ tower , then distinctive cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ √∂hn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and the night to Thursday , the F@@ √∂hn blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ner herd . &quot;
&quot; after fo@@ eh@@ ing on Thursday morning we crossed a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy rain@@ falls , gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest flow . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , on the night to the Wednesday the F@@ √∂hn stops through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows up until Thursday morning in the plac@@ eable valleys with bu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ √∂hn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the mountain slope begins to st@@ ow . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in total , south of the Alps must be accounted for in the next 48 hours with some over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ √∂hn winds up the air , resulting in a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up strongly to stor@@ my weather , and temperatures are much lower . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president , Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday on the name of the German Reform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he received the city as a rotten source of sin . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions should have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
&quot; Luther had then , with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ yss , initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church . &quot;
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now appearing with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who expressed his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subj@@ ectively @-@ artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that address topics like the Way of the Cross , Pla@@ gues , Command@@ ments or Our Father &apos;s Prayer . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological focus , as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , into current contexts . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal Mir@@ ror of Old Pa@@ inting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible text by Martin Luther and one set by the artist , which formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; ultimately , emotions were at all trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and raised in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant ruler . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work this up , in order to be able to tolerate my father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to restore art to more promin@@ ently in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; today &apos;s perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not take care to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes that are important to him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are talking about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
&quot; plans made , place found , companies commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a circular course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration resulted in the expul@@ sion , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill slo@@ ping down , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the First Community Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; further pause &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle nobody can say that it &apos;s not about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be policy .
&quot; the German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a home &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the peripher@@ y of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this programme .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 Prof@@ essors set a clear sign when they are put on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sports director , Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on every day , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; we can use football states , no , we have to use our strength , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach referred to the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot;
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association , together with the German Federal Government and the Federal Government , will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
&quot; according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he dropped onto a water glass after midnight , which he wore in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , was power@@ less , he then dra@@ gged himself out on the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board Meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; Every@@ one can do something like that . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you are gone .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except fighting ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; therefore , during the night race in Singapore , he is just as little as a reserve driver on the weekend as a reserve driver for the two regular pilot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in question , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
judgment : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus were finally defeated in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we can unfortunately not fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ cker on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga match against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach announced openly : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ va will not only change its stem 11 at the R@@ eus position . &quot;
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of Roman citizen Roman b√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe league games in the future , Tu@@ va was open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also compete in the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ceful statement made by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final step for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , keeps the mid @-@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the IA@@ A Fair from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure fewer traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a quick change to digital radio . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the 9 motorway in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver &quot; to avoid additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to ensure that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based on sensors and cameras , which record the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads should not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany , the authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ Transport politicians S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical about their self @-@ prop@@ elled cars - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will succeed in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect 31 per cent believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of the respon@@ dents face up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey by Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in traffic jams 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , each fourth would not leave the car under any circumstances . &quot;
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ Euro
&quot; according to current status , the D√ºsseldorf plans only want to hit singles from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision will be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys got to know it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf , during the Euro course in D√ºsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing event in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ tal in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo , too , was missing , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , we should orient@@ ate ourselves &quot; , &quot; said the World R@@ oo@@ ist Fi@@ fth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins that look da@@ un@@ ting human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 to the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s oeu@@ vre , which hardly has yet to be overlooked , without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; the show is not arranged chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to the cur@@ ator , has driven 14 tons of material . &quot;
shortly before the launch of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is also to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he wore his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot;
he did not have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ er tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long sti@@ ckers in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips developed in large quantities for customers , who , for example , processed them to blankets and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer working today , &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en gran@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace fashion played a major role , was then replaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , borrow@@ ed from past sticks , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who does not use a niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already account for half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with nine other companies , the company P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ¬Æ and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off . &quot;
private specialist stores and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass production is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the embroi@@ dery mil@@ ler in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since then , we have been leading a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; diploma designer , U@@ te Schmidt , teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outside office of the University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small pellets at some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took his inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a piece of memory . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney w@@ akes up to a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic p@@ n@@ ma@@ ids . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

&quot; but the director already says : Ro@@ b Marshall , finally with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned to steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should invest in attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management board adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is drawn up , the sectors and companies identified , which are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is important , since it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guarantees a rule of law and open the market more open , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financi@@ ers and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; the meeting also included Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to dose a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper from the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already bur@@ dened with mercury today that on the basis of the still existing limit values , about 50 per cent of catches cannot be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller peac@@ ef@@ fish , such as car@@ p tend to be so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum levels already today . &quot;
&quot; this is why lowering in the case of Kl@@ einf@@ all is &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy @-@ toxic heavy metal for humans , which is heavily enriched over the food chain in predat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that &quot; already small amounts of substances can cause damage to the nervous system , especially in the case of un@@ born lesi@@ ons . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its website in terms of the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is primarily driven by the burning of coal into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations push for more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount of Germany em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; sustained and nationwide , &quot; had quoted the &quot; mirror &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
