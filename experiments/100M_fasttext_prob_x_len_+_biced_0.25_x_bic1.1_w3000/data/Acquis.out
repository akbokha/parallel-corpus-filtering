&quot; road vehicles or trucks carrying a TI@@ R transport must carry a rectangular panel with the inscription &quot; &quot; TI@@ R &quot; &quot; in front and back . &quot;
these boards must be mounted in such a way that they are well visible ; they must be removable .

&quot; - on the way a control and inspection of the goods loading of road vehicles , trucks or containers . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities take an account of the loading of goods from a road vehicle , a lor@@ ry or a container at a passage duty or on the way , so they must be noted on the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections that are used in their country , the newly established customs associations and the type of checks carried out in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; customs caps in other cases are injured or damaged on the way in articles 24 and 35 , or if goods without breach of customs duties are destroyed or damaged , thus , according to the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 , the instructions for the use of the Car@@ net TI@@ R method and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R are not affected . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the track on which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R does not use the Car@@ net in the territory of a contracting party , because simpler procedures for customs clearance offer or the use of such a procedure is not required . &quot;

&quot; the Car@@ net TI@@ R must be attached to the Car@@ net TI@@ R for charge lists , photographs , plans , etc . , which are required for the protection of goods transported . &quot;
&quot; in this case , she susp@@ ects these papers with their stamp , stit@@ ches one out on the back of the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R wra@@ pping sheet and notices this in all commodities . &quot;
the customs duty points of each contracting party recognize the customs tari@@ ffs and / or in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity labels attached by the competent authorities of the other contracting parties .
&quot; however , you can also add customs and / or nationality markings , but you must pay attention to the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in your country , on the corresponding pedi@@ gre@@ es and on the remaining sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities must remove duty caps or remove debt marks on the way due to an inspection of the cargo load or remove debt marks , so they are inde@@ xed to the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R sections used in their land , on the corresponding pedi@@ gre@@ es and on the remaining sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;

&quot; a satisfactory proof has been provided by the customs authorities , that the goods listed in the commodity manifest@@ o of a Car@@ net TI@@ R have been lost or lost irre@@ tri@@ ev@@ ably , or that they are missing due to their nature by natural sw@@ ings , thus exemp@@ tion from the usual wi@@ dening to significant duties and duties is granted . &quot;

&quot; concentration of the verification procedures on the phases of the fuel circuit that affect the production , processing , use and storage of nuclear materials , from which no other nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives could be produced , and the greatest possible limitation of the verification procedures with other nuclear materials , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To effectively carry out the security measures under this Convention , the Community of the Organization in accordance with this Convention grants information on core material which is subject to securing measures , and on the characteristics of the equipment that are responsible for the implementation of the securing measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organization requires only the minimum of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on plants is limited to the minimum , which is necessary for the use of safety precau@@ tions relating to the core material which is subject to the securing measures under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) In order to seek the Community , the organization is prepared to examine investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable to the premises of the Community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be transferred to the organization material , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization fet@@ ches the consent of the Community and states to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) With@@ drawing the Community either against the proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against a nom@@ ination , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative nam@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization which are imp@@ eded by this Convention , the Council shall discuss the refusal by the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; &quot; General Director &quot; &quot; - to meet the goal of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the States concerned are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , in fact , can carry out the tasks they face after their agreement . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that the possible nu@@ is@@ ance and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
( II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as its inspec@@ tors and other officials who carry out tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the Agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this agreement are concluded with respect to core material , if the community and the organization determine that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the security measures adopted in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken responsibility for the security measures adopted in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents , from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the backup measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; the Community shall agree with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures under this Convention can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the ker@@ atitis should not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the non @-@ use of the safety precau@@ tions following this Convention .
B ) The organization and the community make a provision that the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied only as long as the core material used for such activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under which circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held responsible for the total quantity and composition of this material in the respective state or the states concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a knowledge of military activity and does not relate to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , however , extraordinary expenses as a result of a special search for the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se the costs , provided that it has agreed in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability insurance for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used according to their laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials in the same manner as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or a state against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the association or a state for damages , with the exception of damages arising from a nuclear incident , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; after examining the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council establishes that the organization has not been able to verify that no core material which has to be subject to security measures , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives , may file the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which measure has been acquired by the applied security measures , provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the State concerned to take part in discussing such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not negotiated in the negotiating path or by another of the organization , community and states agreed upon , shall be submitted at the request of a party to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed as arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth to lead the presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure applies if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; this Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; if the organization of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other at the request of one of the parties concerned about a change in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director will immediately notify all Member States of the Organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; this Convention enters into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that its procedures for entry into force have been concluded . &quot;
B ) This agreement remains as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the objective of the preventive measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of significant quantities of nuclear materials of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a decline by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the examination by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone , the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified , stating the degree of accuracy for the specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their reviews , the organization makes after Article 3 full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of its securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely identified and appropriate in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise lost core material and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for assessment of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; a protocol - and reporting system , which identifies the core material stock and the changes in this stock , including the one @-@ and @-@ out of the material balance zone for each type of material ; &quot;
&quot; ( g ) Pre@@ ferences , which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) will introduce ur@@ anium - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material which the phase of the core fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet reached the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; core material which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or if this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the core fuel circulation process is subject to the protection measures mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The provisions specified in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not authorised or desirable , the organization and the community should consult each other via the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community perceive that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following basic material from the security measures adopted in accordance with this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es up the core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under the Convention , from these security measures , provided the entire amount of core material delivered in the States is not at any point in time &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ( II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should the liberated nuclear material be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the securing measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for re @-@ use of the securing measures are met on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which is necessary in the scope that is necessary for successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures defined in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without amend@@ ment of this Convention in agreement between the Organization and the Community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements come into force with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report , the organisation presents a sum@@ mar@@ ised inventory of the underlying core material underlying the hed@@ ging measures in the states irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) &quot;
&quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied up within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and , as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization al@@ ig@@ ns a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special transaction account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction . this account is used by the organization as a ste@@ ward and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the special transaction account is managed separately , separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state , which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans .
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments in front of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional draw on the cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the transaction account appropriately . &quot;
&quot; in granting such loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC : &quot;
the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without conce@@ al@@ ment ; and
VII ) The extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ pa@@ yed development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to procedures and practices , which are considered to be the objective of the Additional under letter b ) of the Pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the organization granted for the organization ; thus , in ten years of free years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay these time@@ pieces must be paid directly to the organization they reserve .
&quot; any special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the funds is specified . &quot;
&quot; the income from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are and the according to what the administrator appointed at the time of the loan guarantee could be the recipient of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments from transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible . &quot;
the ste@@ ward teaches the E@@ EC to complete the complete aband@@ on@@ ment of all transaction loans by the directors in preparation and through the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC teaches quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after the termination of the financial year of the organization , the administrator sends a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the Organization on this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will send a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator through to the full edition of the means of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions and about all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may possibly agree , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of the loan re@@ mitted by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Member States &quot; governments are notified by the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to exclude the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat passes these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is framed in two origin@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter exchange for am@@ ending the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T adopted the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ N@@ TION : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large testing facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a Joint Enterprise after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Venture J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; since up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still extensive work to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contract parties of the present agreement to bring together their relevant efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research projects which have achieved a higher priority due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; by pooling their research efforts in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , this agreement should enable the greatest benefit to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and , accordingly , the common objective of these research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction to achieve faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the Parties associate their respective research programs defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss programme assumes the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; after examination , the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement are extended or modified to include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties receive a new program , this shall take place at the place of the program listed in Anne@@ x I and II . &quot;
&quot; the association , envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 , shall be realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present Agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories that participate in the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 of this Agreement , the parties agree an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as wide as possible to those who are called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s &quot; between the Commission and the States and individuals , in view of the realization of the Eur@@ atom Programme . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom &apos;s aim is to ensure that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of human resources , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Rights &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint venture J@@ ET whose constitution accepts it with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; Eur@@ atom also worries that Switzerland may become contractual partner of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the bodies responsible for the execution of the association , provided in Article 2 ( 1 ) of the present agreement , are described in articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the establishment of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
to monitor and direct the development of research work to achieve the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates representing the connection group employed within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and co @-@ operation with all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , is responsible for all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated bodies and al@@ ig@@ ns its T * uniqu@@ eness in the interest of the two parties to the common objective in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme , as well as to the scientific and technological developments emerging in the world . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG denom@@ inated one or more Swiss representatives in the Advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities requested . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory groups , who submit to the VG research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , carry out this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented in the Committee of Directors appointed by the Eur@@ atom Programme by the Director of one of the participating laboratories .
&quot; the Board of Directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and is responsible for ensuring optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out during the programme , will provide this task with respect to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it ensures the best possible deployment of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and the Swiss Programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordination committees used within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide the committee &apos;s committee with appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , the staff as well as the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , carry out this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development works that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a representative of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country responsible for nuclear and energy research . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions , as well as for the preparation of future programmes and the definition of their overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the area of merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the Advisory groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the VG regarding the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of human resource exchange .
the representatives of the two parties participate in the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of the present agreement .
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set to an amount each year , according to Eur@@ atom &apos;s controversial share of the costs of Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution deals with the participation of Eur@@ atom on the joint enterprise as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland re@@ jects the common company J@@ ET an amount specified in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Enterprise . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of works in the context of the association agreement and agreement on human resources is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used for the calculations of Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are made on the basis of the corresponding agreements . &quot;
&quot; the Commission shares with the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme for the relevant year . &quot;
the Federal Council will pay the Commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
the remaining payment arrangements for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are outlined in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures for Eur@@ atom to be exemp@@ t from duties or other duties as well as import ban and restrictions on the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , the goods purchased or purchased there must not be sold free of charge or free of charge in this country unless the Federal Council appro@@ ves the conditions . &quot;

the BI@@ S could close a stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding application .
&quot; the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future distribution fund of member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , to which application the BI@@ S would be prepared . &quot;
&quot; with each stand @-@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions of extensions , but without that a total of five years are exceeded . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as their possible extension , BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening vision . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws were not made before the end of one month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the BC@@ Cs at the end of the agreement at the available currencies , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be under consideration of the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those applied to the BI@@ S at the given time at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;

&quot; C ) the &quot; &quot; maintenance situation &quot; &quot; is considered &quot; &quot; favourable &quot; &quot; if 1 . information on population dynamics indicate that the mig@@ rat@@ ory species claims to be a viable component of their ecos@@ ystems in the long term ; &quot;
&quot; 2. the spread @-@ area of the wandering species is neither reduced in time , nor seen in the long @-@ term , to be restricted in future ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . both present as well as in the fores@@ eeable future , sufficient space is available to preserve the population of the mig@@ rat@@ ory species in the long run . &quot;
4 . the spread and population size of the mig@@ rating species approach the historical proportions according to extent and extent in a mass in which potentially suitable ecos@@ ystems are present and this is to be agreed with a reasonable effort and use ;

in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the actual amount consumed does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed in accordance with conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the form of offer be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee described in the number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian @-@ regulated access to the community market is not affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the Community ple@@ dges to limit the de@@ ple@@ tion of products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the entry of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the quantity stipul@@ ated under No. 2 corresponding to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , and this will take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion listed in the number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 will be set to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of slaughter body weight with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community . &quot;
the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could adver@@ sely affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community finds provisions that the sale of frozen meat in frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agree that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only take place at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina , in particular , guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by providing export lic@@ ences for the products listed in this Agreement for the products listed in this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in its turn , the Community ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions in order for the issuing of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina from the presentation of a export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit may be wai@@ ved for the distribution of the import license for the goods in question .
&quot; in addition , implementing provisions stipul@@ ate that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority regul@@ ates the quantities in regular intervals for export lic@@ ences ; these details may , if necessary , be deco@@ ded according to country of destination . &quot;

&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb , after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured and that it must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor the following agreement : &quot;

&quot; taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agree that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs takes place only at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the amounts mentioned in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts . &quot;
&quot; the Community , for its part , ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions in order for the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand on the basis of a export license , which is issued by the responsible authority named by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit may be wai@@ ved for the distribution of the import license for the goods in question .

the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label is only one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
&quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is determined on the label , according to the results of the durability tests ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no humidity can enter . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may not exceed 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ orous pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the agent ( or sol@@ vents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) will be able to add an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent continues to provide the conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .

&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
complete anti @-@ D ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % boiling sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; an &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the again sol@@ dered , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ Rh@@ o serum or a corresponding comparison proposal compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all the red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum is supposed to react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to use object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these ser@@ a are specific for the C an@@ tigen only when the blood cells that have been tested are washed up in a 0.@@ 9 % boiling sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended to be used on object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D may contain ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ dd@@ ha@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D may contain ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be directly extracted from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be less than in the ant@@ ech@@ o@@ geneous antibodies . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ations of 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood type B . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ amine human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , that is those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ination does not contain any human red blood cells that do not contain any B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison proposal , with an in@@ und@@ ations of blood cells from group B to titanium ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ations of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary if the same attempt with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity is performed . &quot;
anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins .
