this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. enter@@ prising thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic elation ) alternating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have appe@@ aled to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used to take or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who are preparing the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are broken down like abili@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably works primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree , acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , was studied in three studies for up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a further study , over twelve weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of the Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness using Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received ei@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than those receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , in four of the five short @-@ term studies , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
&quot; moreover , up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo allevi@@ ate symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to absorb ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled strain ) , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes were responding to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , were out@@ weighed against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were responding to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ a@@ emia ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia appear in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ( 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ure@@ tics , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combined identi@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in combination with alcohol or other centrally potent drugs with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metabolism , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the shared gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; once the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or has been removed , the doses of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the can height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to insufficient data for human safety and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies in animal studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to operate hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study lasting over 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study lasting over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study lasting over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ t@@ ank@@ in therapy . &quot;
&quot; in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term study lasting over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; although no information is available on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma retention . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D , the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; with the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks on healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who adher@@ ed to the study medication was similar in both groups ( ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depres@@ sive rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reg@@ ression rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients enrolled and in which the primary study target was &quot; weight gain , &quot; an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg was observed in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies for over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 such as lithium and hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ profil@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the medi@@ an elimination was approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients . &quot;
a specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no signs of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( that is 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study about 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to expos@@ ures of the 3- and 11@@ x the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for dispens@@ ing single cans of aluminum in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;

&quot; 34 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing with Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets may use the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see paragraph 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after onset or after menop@@ ause , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combined identi@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were based on dos@@ ages leading to expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical stage . &quot;
&quot; patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing with Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets may use the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see paragraph 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Dis@@ order - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ C recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients enrolled and in which the primary study target was &quot; weight gain , &quot; an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg was observed in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mid @-@ sized steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to expos@@ ures of the 3- and 11@@ x the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and to minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a secondary oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medication with Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ a@@ emia ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ure@@ tics , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combined identi@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; however , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to the single dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) were intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly used and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metabolism , in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ one inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; once the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or has been removed , the doses of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the can height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; the following side effects appeared more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study lasting over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the long @-@ term study lasting over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in symptoms regarding the ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement observed from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected based on a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who adher@@ ed to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depres@@ sive rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reg@@ ression rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients enrolled and in which the primary study target was &quot; weight gain , &quot; an average weight gain of at least 7 % was observed in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 trials with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15 or 5 times above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns following mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15 ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) to the safety resin path@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to expos@@ ures of the 3- and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel regi@@ men . &quot;
&quot; if only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer were treated for the first time , there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing drugs . &quot;
it should also not be used in patients who have low blood cell numbers in the breast or before the beginning of the treatment .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that , in patients with the first treatment , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing drugs and that it does not have to be given drugs containing other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for placing Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where first @-@ line metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ony &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until a improvement is reached on degrees 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate functioning of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with ren@@ al function impairment ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
no new treatment cycles should be initiated in patients until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; whereas a clear cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity related to Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardi@@ opul@@ mon@@ ary incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is able to experience nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after treatment , no child to produce . &quot;
male patients should be advised to receive treatment prior to treatment as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can affect circulation and the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
the following are the most common and major incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ in in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the abdominal wall , weakness of muscles , genital pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite context in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the integration of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a suspension of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cellular functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the alb@@ umin@@ escent protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ f@@ aded trials and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 than a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metasta@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metasta@@ sis and 19 % due to metasta@@ sis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to finish bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or soft tissue binding from pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; according to the Abra@@ x@@ ane application , the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel application , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver disease and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ureth@@ ral ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data on patients at the age of more than 75 years were available , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorization for the placing on the market will provide the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Education pamp@@ h@@ let • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging supplement . • With a clear visual representation of the correct application of the product , packaged cold boxes for transport by patients . &quot;
this means that the se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also known as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if intra@@ ocular blood don@@ or is not possible prior to surgery and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems , and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , ery@@ thro@@ pod is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be included in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal lack or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced that enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; when administered as an injection into a v@@ ene in the context of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicine . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they either switched to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o inj@@ ected under the skin in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia associated with kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who have been converted to se@@ amed have been maintained to the same extent as those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side effect of se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion . &quot;
se@@ amed cannot be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union regulations , it has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which produces se@@ amed , will provide information packages to medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approved approval to Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the placing of se@@ amed products across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the onset of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned major surgical interventions , which require large blood volume replacement ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations lie between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except in pedi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor is necessary . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed occasionally in a patient or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; an@@ emia symptoms and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical course and condition of disease by the doctor is necessary . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose for control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned food is required , should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed treatment .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive either a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident ; in patients with a recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ physical @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be examined by the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , E@@ umini@@ mag@@ in@@ oxi@@ fication , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is low ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the plat@@ el@@ ets and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of a loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibody should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row is considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity data in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of se@@ amed for patients with a risk of an@@ emia @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In case of maintenance therapy , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded for patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ent coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis liable , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in the case of tumour patients , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response ( patients that may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b @-@ increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see paragraph 4.2 ) , with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should , if possible , examined the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients undergoing a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
furthermore it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post @-@ vascular / vascular events can exist .
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the growing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; hyp@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ opul@@ mon@@ ary isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , ret@@ ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial ren@@ al were reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the genetic epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate percentage with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ as ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; in 1895 , patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ mas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts . &quot;
survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these trials were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls due to a number of common malign@@ ancies . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated IV application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; following sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , irrespective of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last administration . &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis vis @-@ à @-@ vis the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , was not increased ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with nearly 20 times the recommended dosage in humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fat body weight , a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro diagnostic findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store ab@@ se@@ amed un@@ paralleled for a maximum of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gra@@ ding rings and the filling volume is indicated by an adhesive label , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In case of maintenance therapy , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded for patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization must provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials prior to the market launch and , according to agreement with the competent authorities of the member states : • Nutri@@ tional information , labelling and packaging supplement . &quot;
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application application is set up and functioning before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as the medicine brought into circulation is applied .
&quot; the owner of the marketing authorisation is obliged to carry out the Risk Management Plans ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as to update the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • on receipt of new information , which may affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction related ) mil@@ estones • by request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • In a month prior to your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first occurring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of a blood @-@ graf@@ ting in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) occurs - if , for example , such a blood @-@ graf@@ ting occurred at you earlier . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you suffer recently a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent rise in plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ produces during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will regularly carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , loss of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before starting treatment with se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; very rarely , ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ physical @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia , it will break off your therapy with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , se@@ amed by inj@@ ections must be given into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are being treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; if you have elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider dis@@ continuation of the treatment with se@@ amed up until the potassium levels are in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis liable , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your li@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully weighed against the advantages derived from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that being amed has a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you are facing a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , before starting treatment the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get bot@@ tom@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood c@@ lot formation after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / have been taken / used recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( mean to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with se@@ amed , your doctor will need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular t@@ ins of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks , until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending doctor will carry out regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor regards this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ se@@ amed even under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , temporary circulation disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular lesi@@ ons ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot;

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie means that there can no longer be enough red blood cells in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special care when applying se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can occur - regardless of the treatment with se@@ amed - to a drop in blood ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered from a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that alters the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ected into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( a remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies with a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other component .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions of in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis which provides indications of how to use the medicine as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is present .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data on safety and efficacy are missing . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
the incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as a serious side effect increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium @-@ values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed up to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after dosing z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the area of the jaw was , particularly in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
&quot; 7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric ed@@ dies frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius significantly compared to placebo ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip decreased by 6.@@ 0 % , the fem@@ al neck around 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the basin .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ ct ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the retention of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
&quot; bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum was determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
&quot; B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline level after 12 months , and was held at 55 % below bas@@ eline for up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 Pati@@ ents ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo for all time points .
&quot; compared to placebo , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo , and 4.3 % on the don@@ or neck . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and the BM@@ D was evaluated in 185 patients after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , mainly light to moderate disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase after 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.6 @-@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day for 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as respon@@ dents at the end of the six month study were eligible for a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic approach to 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron could be maintained in a mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ e- independent . &quot;
&quot; then the plasma levels quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal phase of elimination of t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages of distribution ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , whereas the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body clearing is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the concentration of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; reduced clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabol@@ ite inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; specific patient populations ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ atine @-@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no c@@ anned @-@ adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid requires .
&quot; as for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intraven@@ ous inj@@ ectable intraven@@ ous dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for trials in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al compatibility of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was obtained , in that doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg were administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , showed toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was marked at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum calcium level . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application works and works before and during the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all the following versions of the R@@ MP , approved by the CH@@ MP , are required to carry out the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could influence the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed uni@@ form@@ ly , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta acts by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines / have been taken / applied recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
&quot; when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with foods and drinks , be sure to take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; as Ac@@ la@@ sta acts for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions precisely so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed send immediately to your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
&quot; prior to the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta In case you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta does this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms in yourself after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs of low calcium levels in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , ti@@ redness , ting@@ ling / stu@@ ff@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , trem@@ bling , temporary unconscious , taste disorder , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , stomach pain , hypertension , facial redness , rash , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue swelling and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported especially in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) were reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently hydr@@ ated ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice a daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently received low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or above respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting smoking compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on setting smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this area of application was difficult to estimate . &quot;
the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts to a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight people
&quot; medicines used in patients who require medical and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( by providing educational packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which in addition have one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of the patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ t may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any visible risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the recur@@ rence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice when these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ . l@@ n

&quot; we examined overweight patients and patients with obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated with weight reduction and accompanying metabolic disorders .
&quot; although the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG In the evaluation of side effects , the following frequencies are based : &quot;
&quot; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only light symptoms were observed in a study in which a limited number of individuals administered up to 300 mg of dispos@@ able doses of up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg for A@@ comp@@ lia , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference between 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference between -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years , the difference in weight reduction between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo was 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Wei@@ ght reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients with no diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; among Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average waste of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( initial value tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo &quot;
&quot; the percentage of patients reaching H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % , was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group . &quot;
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; 2 hours , the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 ng / ml ; trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; food In@@ flu@@ ence : in the case of food intake , he showed an 67 % increase in C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % in the food supply . &quot;
patients with black skin colour may have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popular ( age spectrum 18 @-@ 81 years ) estimates that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , but were affected in animals after exposure in the human@@ istic area , were considered to be relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the onset of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle problems . &quot;
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etal medicine ) is not indicated .
&quot; it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the current dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of acet@@ one treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin ; in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the addition of placebo was reduced by 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos increased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any other component , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that in the frame of a mon@@ otherapy ( for the sole use ) , Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently regulated with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients affected by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rop@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values can be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper abdom@@ en complaints , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme measurements must be checked . &quot;
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is continued should be directed by the clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters are present .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been established , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases related to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oco@@ ag@@ ulation ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ ent or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market introduction of Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ one , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an appearance or deterioration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma was reported with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel block@@ ers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not appreciated from available data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeded the upper limit of the normal range as often as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea . &quot;
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rop@@ ascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was suspected .
&quot; since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ tim@@ ation medications was carried out . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study lasting over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilisation in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy continued for two years to study the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the onset of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( over 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three @-@ month improvement period with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabe@@ tics in a small study of 18 weeks .
&quot; in most clinical trials , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids as well as a slight increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels were observed in most clinical trials , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plastic matrix gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study lasting more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rop@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma generally 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to the oral application of radioactive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma @-@ elimination @-@ time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the parent substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies were performed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated appointment of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia , and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting from the gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) elevated incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ onic tumours .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in a further study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were analyzed with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for more than one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study lasting more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tr@@ yp@@ hic gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the goal of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , coron@@ ary ar@@ mon@@ ary ar@@ tery and re@@ vit@@ re@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparative medications , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures observed in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in a study lasting more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use the insulin .
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human insulin analog .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar ( see the full list of the packaging supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose has been inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensive insulin therapy can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warnings and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if the change to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient requires a dose adjustment , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warnings of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
&quot; when travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor has to consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other medications taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can result in loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain function disorders and even death .
diseases of the nervous system - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A quick improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
&quot; 5 . intensi@@ fying insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;
diseases of the skin and skin tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection site may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the in@@ let points within the injection area .
&quot; during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain , and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disturbances , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic ede@@ ma , respiratory problems , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fa@@ inting / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total working duration amounts to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human tin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the division are active .
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity . &quot;
it is recommended - after removing the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane water bottle from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin is to rise to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the manual for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warnings of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
&quot; therefore , the doctor has to consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other medications taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 12 . both hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o . &quot;
&quot; 13 . intensi@@ fying insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life ( t ½ ) is therefore more a measure of resor@@ ption than a measure of the elimination per se of insulin from the plasma ( insulin has in the blood@@ stream a t ½ of just a few minutes ) .

Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of quick acting insulin has to be raised , followed by the amount of long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 . if the change to Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the patient requires a dose adjustment , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; when travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain , and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) . &quot;

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total working duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years old ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years old ) .
&quot; the data is limited , however , suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion systems with acet@@ p@@ id in concentrations of 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in the in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - Glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature 24 hours at room temperature . &quot;

always set the cap of your Flex@@ Pen product when it is not in use to protect it from light .
&quot; F Ke@@ ep the Flex@@ Pen with the injection needle up and tap a few times with your finger against the cartridge , so that existing bubbles accumulate at the top of the cartridge . &quot;
&quot; the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards , by turning the dose knob in the appropriate direction until the correct dose is opposite to the dose of the dose indicator . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or pla@@ ques ( &quot; stones &quot; ) that can lead to joint and bone damage . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking further medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( apparent drug ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood count below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once received 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea , skin rash and abnormal liver function ) . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in the reduction of the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood , aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mal deposits ( including a report of rheum@@ atism known or currently present , and / or arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum post @-@ acid bar still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose @-@ increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see paragraph 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other resin @-@ acid @-@ enhancing drugs , acute rheum@@ atism may occur during the treatment of the treatment because of the reduction of the serum post @-@ acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials slight anom@@ ali@@ es of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before beginning the F@@ ebu@@ o@@ che treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ SK did not conduct AC studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that X@@ O inhibit@@ ors can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a inhi@@ bit of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects the simultaneous application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen was 250 mg twice a day with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of n@@ apro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ ci@@ dal , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , slow@@ ed down the intake of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a reduction in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not imply side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or fet@@ al health .
&quot; experimental studies do not imply direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see paragraph 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total budget study group in the Phase 3 pi@@ vot@@ al study ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years . &quot;
adverse events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ ghing , short breath , skin dis@@ color@@ ations , skin lesi@@ ons , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ia , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ in@@ metabolic in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cas@@ cade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → urine acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) inhibit@@ or with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro blocking , which is located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly dose levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study demonstrated the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 vs. Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 vs. 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of serum resin levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained over the entire treatment dur@@ ably .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 times a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C received the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg of 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum res@@ ins in subjects irrespective of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum res@@ ins ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT ) had a ser@@ um@@ aric acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data gathered in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent reduction of serum res@@ ins on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients do not require treatment against rheum@@ atism ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the plaster cast size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at were higher proportional to doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , greater than the dose @-@ proportional rise . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg of 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in the serum resin concentration provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma retention of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are primarily formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ lab@@ elled F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool was found as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
&quot; 12 Li@@ ver dysfunction following intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ pu@@ gh classification B ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not change significantly compared to normal liver function . &quot;
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites following intake of multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; in male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly d@@ osed treated group , with approximately 11 @-@ times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a consequence of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by a decrease in breeding capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.4 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which dec@@ ru@@ de about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not show ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application , is ready before the medicine is put into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP is to be presented according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline on risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for risk minim@@ ization • within 60 days after achieving important mil@@ estones ( phar@@ ma vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach levels that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low due to the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the crystal formation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
&quot; tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration following a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease where too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before starting treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary in order to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / have been taken / used recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use drugs that may appear as one of the following substances as interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on traffic jams and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , the single days of the week are printed , so you can check if you have taken one tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company presented data showing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en , and aci@@ dic b@@ umps . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergic ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other component . &quot;
it must not be used in case of disorders of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a licence for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , identified with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow the instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side @-@ effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • Dur@@ ing the day , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ th@@ opla@@ sty , be given only under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; reactions such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ ant reactions , and the patients should be advised to stop the treatment of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms , which point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a ( after market introduction ) were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ cardi@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there is no data available that indicates whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require ortho@@ don@@ tic surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE for the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the dose of one tablet a week as originally planned on the intended day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports originate from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , taking of serum @-@ calcium up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ flu@@ ence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of vitamin D@@ 3 is increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia may lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

&quot; after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) as in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) . &quot;
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s therapeutic equivalent of 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 m@@ g. a day ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi@@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture @-@ intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the average BM@@ D asc@@ ents with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the verteb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the incl@@ ines of BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ters continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new ed@@ ar frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15,@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption Be@@ en to intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after overnight fast and two hours before taking a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in tissue tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed to the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted in 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not thought that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; characteristics in patients prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it can be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body . &quot;
&quot; tre@@ mor ( trem@@ bling ) , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased level of potassium ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Ad@@ an@@ agra@@ ph dose or dose of the concur@@ rent medication may need to be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded Yellow @-@ orange Gel@@ atin capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close scrut@@ iny of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable with both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the dosage can take several days before the steady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral treatment of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for making an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application In order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dosage adap@@ tations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
recommended Dos@@ age - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f Do a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted to once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f has this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) based on the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ t must start for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; for adults , who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day should be taken daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts , gra@@ ft transplan@@ ted patients received a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups , patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tal@@ lies in the target range , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction . &quot;
&quot; since kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine levels , a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine calculation and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level mirror in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ k@@ back control .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ k@@ back mirrors of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after adjustment of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dosage adjustment , modifications of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood exceed 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the blood vessels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in cardi@@ oid and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close scrut@@ iny of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation are not yet available . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t receivers and gra@@ ft receivers in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation inf@@ ant is available . &quot;
taking vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) is due to possible interactions that may result in a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus hygiene .
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , Pro@@ gra@@ f found a hyper@@ tro@@ phy known as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy which , therefore , can also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. ) &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ert , lac@@ tose present , special care is required in patients with rare heredi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ aller@@ genic mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while taking substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
&quot; a strong interaction with anti@@ fung@@ al drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase the hormone level , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , observation of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the secondary efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant is often difficult to determine because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects following their frequency are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known for other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it has been reported using ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zable . &quot;
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent activation of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
&quot; 12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % , and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) . &quot;
&quot; patient survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0,8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ Arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) occurred . &quot;
&quot; kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t receivers . &quot;
&quot; patient survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ Arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) occurred . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing fol@@ low @-@ up@@ - data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ ance C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs. C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs. C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 3 ( men ) , in Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) occurred . &quot;
&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplantation . &quot;
&quot; transplantation of 175 patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation , and in 6@@ 30 cases after intestinal transplantation were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies met the observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ acy syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0,8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ osis and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
a multi@@ center study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation which were random@@ ised to receive Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached at the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study of oral pro@@ gra@@ pher as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplantation showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ zumab , leading to dam@@ s between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids shall be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .
&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly through the bile . &quot;
systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower in stable patients ( once daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( mg : mg ) compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f .

&quot; advice is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) . &quot;
dosage and frequency of the application are depending on whether adv@@ ection is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer@@ ers suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced that enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; adv@@ ant is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called &quot; &quot; Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , &quot; &quot; but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new bleeding episodes with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ant ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated . &quot;
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , an adequate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differentiate in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ lives . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis The long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the speed of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the VI@@ II factor , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; in the largest number of patients A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all treated with previously untreated patients , who had a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 days postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
&quot; the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained over the course of the day , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentration ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days . &quot;
in addition none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentration ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a prolonged peak of antibody @-@ level anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that had an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ co@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters are derived from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still considered the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder is supposed to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited shared the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , normally the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and therefore no infection can trigger in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , allowing the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein once more . &quot;
&quot; p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene contained in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the sub@@ structure , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial submission of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP requests a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tumours provides benefits for patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ ac @-@ Use &quot; programmes with lawyers .
&quot; modified ingredient release means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately , and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of a@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are dis@@ gra@@ ded . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms in the last 12 hours were . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was examined , the patients with a@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who alone received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disturbances and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any other component , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular disease , including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for introducing Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking them , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have dropped .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , eph@@ ed@@ rine etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data did not suff@@ ice to reach appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment should be stopped in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pit@@ falls , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or ampli@@ fication of headache ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with a heart rhythm disorder • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ dati@@ d ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is required at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to the indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the context of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with a placebo and those treated with placebo , irrespective of whether or not that lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of a@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , however , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not give rise to the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impairment of traffic jam or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential le@@ thal processes . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ dial pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ cu@@ le as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ tin gene on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ ep@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving a@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of a@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine by the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the effectiveness of a@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; according to the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium was reached by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects suffered des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n badly . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was equivalent to exposure to the administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the filing application , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effects . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drinking or it@@ chy eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the s@@ wollen drug pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to a nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ ms in the medical history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor if you have the following symptoms or diseases to occur or be diagnosed : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or ampli@@ fication of existing headaches . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking medication with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when used in the recommended dosage , it is not necessary to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of a@@ ero ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of a@@ ero ze than you should .
&quot; if you forgot the intake of a@@ ero , if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this manual .
&quot; heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disturbances , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; heart pal@@ pit@@ ations or ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , increased physical activity , redness , flus@@ hing , confusion , blur@@ red vision , dry eyes , nas@@ al bleeding , nas@@ al irritation , nas@@ al sin@@ uses , nas@@ al sin@@ uses , nas@@ al sin@@ uses , irritation of the nas@@ al sin@@ us , irrit@@ able liver function , rest@@ lessness , anxiety and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; also very rarely reported cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pains , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of eye @-@ catching liver values . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate to take ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and / or &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or m@@ illed . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight trials involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( among them four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had also asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the pain , impairment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the acceptance of the scores after six weeks was treated with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any other component . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and may be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed .
&quot; in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been established in clinical trials with Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impairment of traffic jam or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more than placebo reported fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with disaster and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) was administered .
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ cu@@ le as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ tin gene on end@@ otheli@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for more than 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dosage ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated . &quot;
in a single dose study with adults Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ag@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and can be recru@@ ited by chronic patients . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that , except in the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also possible to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the ju@@ ck@@ rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of the patients treated with Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wa@@ xing , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients with the general seasonal allergic Rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reached in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not appear on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n toxic@@ ity profile . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety resin , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n reveal no particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ der@@ mal , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken irrespective of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by an infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; besides the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age have met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who normally metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ aller@@ genic absorption or su@@ c@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ ol@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup Group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were administered . &quot;
&quot; children between 1 and 11 years of age , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily daily dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; since the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for more than 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dosage ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents has not determined an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor impairment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced impairment nor an increase in sleep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; in adults and young patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that would severely met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation following once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different one @-@ dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;

&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and taken from the ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate dosage without damaging them . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets per day than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dosage ) were applied .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for more than 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dosage ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day .
&quot; in a 17 single dose study of adults , 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the stress caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic Rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was reached in 4 % of the patients . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets daily in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray is removed without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets for children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the disaster and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dosage , A@@ eri@@ us was found to be the bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate to take part in the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , was not statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of the prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical tri@@ ple@@ tion tests for the melting tablets revealed that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are severely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who normally metabol@@ ise normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ ali@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as in the placebo group .
&quot; in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more than placebo reported diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , there were no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg . &quot;
&quot; at recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents has not determined an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce stress caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
different single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the use of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from person to person , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly in a contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for use , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient had previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gen@@ ase depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gen@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not to cure , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infection related to AIDS and diseases . &quot;
&quot; am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gen@@ ase , which was strengthened with a low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to be prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children treated with prot@@ esters earlier . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gen@@ ase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under ag@@ ility together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to patients who continued their prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are broken down just like a gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines against HIV , patients who take as@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic enh@@ ancer , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; am@@ gener@@ ase was initially approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a licence for the placing of A@@ gen@@ ase in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
&quot; normally , am@@ bush capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance mut@@ ations and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not ex@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If am@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see paragraph 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of being transmitted from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre@@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ag@@ round with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ i@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; for some medications which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation content of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , A@@ gen@@ ase should be reduced to 5 . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ hibit@@ ors were reported to have been reported to have diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an ex@@ as@@ cer@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases with which drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug addic@@ ted factors , such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; reports on ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors include an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis are reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were observed very frequently . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels are and , if possible , check the viral load and replace the St. John &apos;s Wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; in contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were administered twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan . &quot;
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , obtained twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the sac@@ ros@@ ity component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ ci@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; should these drugs be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ viruses could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
caution is advised when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
&quot; the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin caused a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side @-@ effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gen@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors , can potentially lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with am@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids cannot be taken at the same time as a gener@@ ase since it can result in resor@@ ption problems .
&quot; simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase the plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days on subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous application of am@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected to increase the plasma levels while taking A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the gener@@ ase cannot be used in combination with oral m@@ ori@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase a stronger control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time administered by A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother , this drug may be applied to the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ ing rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in people . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by am@@ ni@@ fication in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side @-@ effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment break@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated as related to study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and thor@@ u@@ bic fat accumulation ( bull &apos;s ) . &quot;
&quot; among 113 patients treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients treated in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medi@@ an duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ por@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontaneously occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks , without requiring treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in PI pre@@ treated patients , who received 600 mg of a@@ gen@@ ase twice a day together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception were increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which were treated very frequently in patients who received am@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ction ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ sth@@ eses with the consequence of an education of un@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r therapeutic chemicals with prot@@ e@@ as@@ hibit@@ ors , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically studied . &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / F / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M with a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ol @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly ro@@ amed with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ difference threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution for In@@ take and Cap@@ sul@@ es in doses of 15 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; no low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s , together with A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , treatment optimisation in PI pre@@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the medi@@ an duration amounts ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound aspir@@ in that represents the active portion probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound aspir@@ in remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration at the steady state via the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given concur@@ r@@ ently ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily basis exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules , hence A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , which is why the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those observed twice a daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous dosing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas comp@@ acted with doses of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which contained bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rat and chromos@@ ome abl@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this h@@ ep@@ atic toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the daily routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of am@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mor@@ t@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , have been observed in a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 . if A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines causing serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , A@@ gen@@ ase should be reduced to 27 . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , obtained twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
caution is advised when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gen@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il increase . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days on subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase a stronger control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous adoption of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol up to 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by am@@ ni@@ fication in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ction ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ol @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , treatment optimisation in PI pre@@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound aspir@@ in remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration at the steady state via the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given concur@@ r@@ ently ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas comp@@ lied with doses of the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application . &quot;

&quot; toxic@@ ity studies in young animals , treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mor@@ t@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in juven@@ iles the metabolism paths are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ hibit@@ or ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years , the A@@ gen@@ ase Solution is indicated . &quot;
the use of P@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase Solution for recording was not documented either in PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not ex@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of ag@@ round solution for inser@@ ting and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gen@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ gen@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of being transmitted from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines causing serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , it should be removed permanently . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; reports on ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors include an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am expects significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration . &quot;
&quot; the potential risk for humans is not known . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , it may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ ing rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in people . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by am@@ ni@@ fication in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gen@@ ase or another medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r therapeutic chemicals with prot@@ e@@ as@@ hibit@@ ors , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may have a negative impact on subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , treatment optimisation in PI pre@@ treated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ to volume and an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

the benefit of patients treated with the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase Solution was not proven with patients previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
for applying low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( commonly used to strengthen the effect &#91; boo@@ ster &#93; of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules ) along with A@@ gen@@ ase remedy for intake can not be given dosage recommendations .
&quot; take the k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution , or take propylene gly@@ co@@ l while taking A@@ gen@@ ase solution ( see also A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be taken ) . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may observe you for side effects that are related to the propylene gly@@ col@@ ine of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution to intake , especially if you have a kidney or liver disease . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking certain drugs that may cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , ra@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize possible safety issues . &quot;
&quot; k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution , or additional propylene gly@@ co@@ l , should not be taken while taking A@@ gen@@ ase ( see A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be taken ) . &quot;
&quot; important information about certain other components of A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s solution to take @-@ in The solution to intake includes propylene gly@@ co@@ l , which can lead to side effects in high doses . &quot;
&quot; propylene gly@@ co@@ l can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , heart rate and the reduction of the red blood cells ( see also A@@ gen@@ ase may not be taken , special caution when taking A@@ gen@@ ase is required precau@@ tions ) . &quot;

&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , fat gain in the abdom@@ en and other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation , and fat shr@@ ink@@ age in the neck ( &quot; &quot; Sti@@ cks &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , synthetic chew@@ ing gum , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week for a maximum of 16 weeks . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; before going to bed , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin , so that they remain on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before being washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo was carried either daily or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tumor after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin stal@@ ks .
&quot; • In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • The complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ cal ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient will carry on the cream as soon as he / she notices it and continue with the usual treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and cleaned in the cleaned areas infected with fi@@ gs , until the cream is fully re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
there should be a balance between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
there should be an atten@@ u@@ ation between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host response .
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ ort was performed , two cases of serious phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stri@@ k@@ ture leading to circumc@@ ision were observed . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ations ( see paragraph 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or had a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the end of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , necess@@ itating emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications for treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral area , no clinical experience has yet to be found . &quot;
&quot; although limited data points to an increased rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility to HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients regarding the disposal of the genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment has ended .
&quot; as there are currently no data available for long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in the case of super @-@ certified bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; no clinical experience is present in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been examined for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ish ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin patients in anatom@@ ical locations outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin stal@@ k on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but normally these reactions take on intensity in the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that patients with more than 8 active lesi@@ ons showed a lower healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesi@@ ons .
&quot; due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although no quanti@@ fiable level of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are not quanti@@ fiable after a one @-@ time or repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given to use during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions to the site of the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported in 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial were shown below .
the most common one as likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported in Phase III clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ase / removal / removal ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) . &quot;
&quot; this assessed according to the study plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very frequently leads to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and to severe scar@@ ring and cal@@ ci@@ fication ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin stal@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental one @-@ time oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , persi@@ sted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study systemic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been proven after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy of an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the case of 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the clin@@ ically treated patients were healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete healing could be reached in 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks , over 6 weeks , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a cohesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , the approved indications are superficial fi@@ gs , ac@@ tin stal@@ k and super @-@ bacterial cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks ) .
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application to MC @-@ ill skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that observed in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours to the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for the human being is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

● Fe@@ eding war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itali@@ a ( genital organs ) and anus ( anus )
&quot; if left untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - that is why early diagnosis and treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin @-@ like ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to radiation during their previous life . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin stal@@ k or the virus responsible for infection with infected war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar drugs earlier , please inform your doctor before you start treatment . o inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by flus@@ hing with water . o Do not irrit@@ ate the cream in@@ war@@ dly . o Do not use any more cream as your doctor prescribed you . if reactions take place after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream do not cause severe discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . o inform your doctor if they have no normal blood pattern &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling of the fores@@ kin can be expected with increased incidence of swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area during intercourse , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is performed . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently been used , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
do not breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream because it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od occurs in breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of fi@@ gs , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ c@@ ine ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin area with the cow@@ ards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
men with genital war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see paragraph 2 &quot; What do you have to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .

&quot; if your skin re@@ acts to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a reduced number of blood cells can make you more prone to infections , and it can cause a blue stain to occur more quickly , or it can cause sleep . &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this manual .
&quot; in addition , you can experience it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , it is a lighter skin reaction that res@@ oun@@ ds within 2 weeks after the treatment is removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes to the place of application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , skin irritation , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes at the application site ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , scar@@ ring and scar@@ ring , ul@@ cer@@ ation , swelling , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , sore throat , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , body aches , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye disease . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ ation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be announced and , where necessary , update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms will observe patients receiving al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of Al@@ ac@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a safe diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years of age have not been determined and no dos@@ ages can be recommended for these patients .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dos@@ ages can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting in which re@@ vit@@ ation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients develop Ig@@ G antibodies against the lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously demonstrated after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before beginning of the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ rites ) to be treated in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction has occurred .
al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not imply direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via the breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 trial ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the phase 3 trial and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a phase 2 trial with a total of 20 patients under 5 years of age , with predominantly severe form and duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby the patients at the age of 5 were mostly in a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the phase 3 study ( resp@@ . to premature ej@@ ection from the study ) 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies that were det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ o ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients , in which there was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms for a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me had an improvement in lung function and the ability to function in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V was clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of adults .
&quot; of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first four weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; overall improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ off gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no prescription studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines other than the ones listed in the 6.@@ 6 . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and patients who had previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( one vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin it should be given an &quot; &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study involving 4@@ 56 patients who had not received chemotherapy for their disease before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study involving 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer before . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells had longer survival compared to the settlement drug in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each penetration bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary doses is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100@@ ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ c@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood sample should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and plat@@ el@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose examination must take place taking into account the na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 Blood .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ - a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above compared to patients at the age of 65 there is an increased side @-@ effectiveness risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , dose adap@@ tations were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ≥ 45 ml / min which extend beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
&quot; the data layer in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin level and / or Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase value of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored in terms of bone market penetration and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils once again reached a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ony , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the degree of 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia have been observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 occurred .
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce toxic@@ ity ( see paragraph 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cer@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ efer , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible restriction of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised to consult with regard to sperm conservation prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
precau@@ tion is therefore advised when high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or as@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs is present with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed must be avoided at least 2 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal ised R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites serious birth defects are expected during an application during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be used during pregnancy , except when it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice on the block of sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed enters the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma and the random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed - and 163 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for the inclusion of all events in which the reporting physician held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for possible . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ities that were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to the results of three different P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to be attributed to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ ge@@ al 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that may arise in connection with study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC , who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ities that were reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ities that were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were ran@@ - dom@@ ed c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed included :
&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in hospital studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent . &quot;
&quot; patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ gi@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were occasionally reported in clinical trials .
there have been reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a number of attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ e synthesis ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ co@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only be@@ ck@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ ne@@ a ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ otheli@@ oma was shown in the treatment of the Lun@@ - gen@@ us cancer symptom@@ sc@@ ala in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC was treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was achieved in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) prec@@ lin@@ ical treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the products . &quot;
&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , whereby about a quarter of the fats that have been fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received 60 mg of all@@ i had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stool , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , removal of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a licence for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a mild hypo@@ cal@@ ory , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
all@@ i must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed minim@@ ally , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Dur@@ ation period ( see section 4.6 ) • Dur@@ ation treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicine for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional measures to prevent pregnancy , in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the event of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study of drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ases is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were identified from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years , and were generally mild and temporary . &quot;
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
the incidence of known adverse events detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause side effects with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight patients over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in most cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on tests on humans and animals , a rapid re@@ formation of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at li@@ pas@@ ol @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect prev@@ ails in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ a@@ ases .
&quot; it is derived from clinical studies that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months . &quot;
the average Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin showed with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with a placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; if you miss a meal or a meal does not contain any fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , you risk food @-@ related side effects ( see paragraph 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to the new eating habits , start with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet before taking the first capsules . &quot;
diet di@@ aries are effective as you can understand what you eat and how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your dietary habits .
&quot; in order to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
• Nutri@@ ent fatty acids to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects ( see paragraph 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active during the intake and after the ing@@ es@@ tion of all@@ i .
&quot; • all@@ i may not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you are not able to reduce your weight after 12 weeks of application , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not about changing your diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this manual .
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , causing more fat to be ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you may not have drastically reduced the amount of fat in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not on to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep out of the container tightly for children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serves to keep the capsules dry .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi across the European Union to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in case of severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; because pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ estic distress or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such length@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs investigated against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ ano@@ dis@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady st@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , r@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least associated with al@@ op@@ ic were headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were shown as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis trials were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , given intraven@@ ously at day 1 . &quot;
the results of studies with moder@@ ately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are sum@@ mar@@ ised in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study , which was conducted in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers , was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. of administered p@@ alle@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; following intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the medi@@ an ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that once a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days , the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ able dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ alter@@ able substance made about 40 % of the given dosage . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy patients , the total body weight was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver dysfunction are likely to increase the terminal status of the exclusion diet and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered to be sufficient above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and as Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this authorisation for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the drug approved in the course of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the announcement of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C medicine was recommended by al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ like component that has already been approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ scopic investigation , liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that stimulates these to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon introduces data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients in the study of hepatitis C patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus detected in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ a.@@ new@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ new@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided by the CH@@ MP .
&quot; furthermore , concerns were vo@@ iced that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease resum@@ ed in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug answers an immune response ( i.e. the body makes antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection with a crust formation ) and small infected ra@@ ids ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used for treating infections that have been prov@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were considered together with skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stained @-@ up cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were prov@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most frequent side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the Con@@ tractor .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ zer@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be started . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used for treating infections , where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations observed in people after topical application on isolated skin or infected superficial wounds ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the medi@@ an ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ a@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine on the sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not required if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued , the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman is to weigh . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most reported side @-@ effect irritation was at the administration place , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation of C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ory of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50 sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer center .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should the local pre@@ valence of resistance apply to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , advice should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as p@@ ant@@ on @-@ val@@ ent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ a@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine was applied to intact and isolated skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; in 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ a@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secon@@ dar@@ ily infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients either before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake in people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP @-@ inhibit@@ ing . &quot;
metabolism The in vitro antioxid@@ ant metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in trials of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro @-@ check on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were no signs of restricted fertility in male or female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ographic application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ) : &quot;

Ambi@@ x is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ x is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
&quot; therefore , Ambi@@ x can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be completed . &quot;
&quot; if a ris@@ er dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act by helping the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; how it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ x contains the same ingredients as the imm@@ uni@@ zed vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix adults , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ines that have been approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ x and Twin@@ rix are included adults identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ x conducted between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody levels for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ x &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ iness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients or any of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals a licence for Ambi@@ rix &apos;s placing on the market &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is requested for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons , who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , need a refres@@ her as protection as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine , appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value is achieved after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ x can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it can lead to bleeding in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernal symptoms , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in former Thi@@ omer@@ ase and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ernal mortality , based on a basis for a calculation based on the Ambi@@ tious immun@@ isation dose , but not based on a calculated base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given to Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of matri@@ tr@@ inity was comparable to 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ernal mortality was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient matrix group was comparable to that observed with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ance , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; statisti@@ cally , the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ tious or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ines with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans were given Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three cans . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 compared with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were reached a month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , month 7 ) in a clinical comparative study , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that , which was found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was given at the age of two at the same time with the collection of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ opo@@ i@@ dis@@ - and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series with 2 doses has been completed . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
it cannot be convey@@ ed to other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection .
&quot; • If your child already has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has already occurred with you / your child for an early vacc@@ ination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ inations , the doctor will advise you / your child of a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ x is inj@@ ected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; atmosphere can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medications ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has been planned or planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case , the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , there should be vacc@@ inations in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ x is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ x is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remained positive on the basis of the data that has become known since issuing the first permit for placing on the market .
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ x was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is administered - divided into several single doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered by a gastro@@ intestinal tube ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose @-@ probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ ella can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fa@@ inting , fluid retention , taste problems or taste , stomach ache , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information about this drug was available . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use , if there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein up@@ take of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium @-@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ acet@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to get ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium @-@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme care in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the significance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in human breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least an adverse event ( AE ) occurred at 56 % of the patients and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with Lak@@ sh@@ ac@@ ia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
one case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl acet@@ ate , which in an intraven@@ ous dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) , and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of sodium @-@ containing sodium chlori@@ de between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen separation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium @-@ poly@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with time with many intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ or@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium @-@ ammon@@ ia @-@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are not reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium @-@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral one dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycl@@ ine disrup@@ tions or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the next morning after fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium @-@ poly@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no adverse effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets , or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ hip or a nose @-@ probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium @-@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ acet@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium @-@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat f@@ ads were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex emerged . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with Lak@@ sh@@ ac@@ ia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess
&quot; based on tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that poly@@ phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are not reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral one dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were observed . &quot;
&quot; during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains a small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium @-@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if you are conducting laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency stop of your hospital for the purpose of treating a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; 30 When laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses or@@ ally or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose @-@ probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Sub@@ mit a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top edge of the knife , to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate out of the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ography is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain the flow of blood to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ec@@ tomy was compared with a single administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination of He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often became a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ enti@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ogen@@ ic - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ogen@@ esis should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ ri@@ pen@@ dine , hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other component . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who had a bleeding recently , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ogen@@ esis in the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the placing of angi@@ ec@@ enters throughout the European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) during emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ec@@ tomy in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a further PCI is performed in the case of the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt placement of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ Gift of Angi@@ oid was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt placement of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose should be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value exceeds 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given properly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al dysfunction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again . &quot;
patients with moderate kidney damage included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) .
&quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , Angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with Angi@@ oid can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• well known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ ologically is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in the case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in arter@@ ial points of the disease , in patients suffering from a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding can generally occur throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with biochem@@ hi@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the pre @-@ treatment level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of biochem@@ ists with plat@@ el@@ ets or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be monitored regularly . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , removal or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone . 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more frequent adverse events in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- or inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , decrease in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding area , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI trial . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ant group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , there were more frequent adverse events in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ant must be immediately dis@@ connected and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; Angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as to the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because in turn th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din showed no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were distributed equally over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ographic in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din have been evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as a pe@@ p@@ tide goes through a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent replacement of the amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; the primary met@@ abo@@ ite , which results from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
the elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminal half @-@ time of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in animals during repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10 @-@ times of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to superior pharmac@@ ological effects .
&quot; side effects following a longer @-@ term physiological strain as a response to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure to those in clinical use , even at very much higher dosage . &quot;

&quot; Angi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose penetration bottles made of type 1 glass to 10 ml , closed with a but@@ yl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium . &quot;
&quot; 5 ml of sterile water for injection purposes are given into a penet@@ rating bottle of Angi@@ oid and easily turned until everything has completely dissolved , and the solution is clear . &quot;
5 ml will be removed from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml bi@@ ologically .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm , or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot work insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery was determined after six months . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human regular insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any other ingredient or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and dimin@@ ished insulin release , the insulin requirement in patients can be reduced with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change in effect , the brand ( manufacturers ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ lag , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dose or breakdown of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
a patient &apos;s switching to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the extent of the insulin used and can therefore change when switching the treatment plan .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation should be weakened or missing under the influence of sympath@@ ies such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use . &quot;

&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy App@@ lies to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , as a result a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a trained person , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ cos@@ al injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that at an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with a human regular insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was obtained , a better post@@ ker@@ at@@ al control was achieved than with a human regular insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with a human regular insulin which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal is reached ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal compared to human regular insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human regular insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ mal mal@@ functioning , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
