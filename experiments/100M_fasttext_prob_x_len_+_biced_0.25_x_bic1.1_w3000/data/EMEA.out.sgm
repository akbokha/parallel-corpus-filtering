<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you need further information about your illness or their treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if you require further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. enterprising thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexic elation) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have appealed to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used to take or the enamel tablets in patients who are preparing the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are broken down like abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably works primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree, acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, was studied in three studies for up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in a further study, over twelve weeks, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of the Abilify injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness using Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received eify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than those receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, in four of the five short-term studies, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo alleviate symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to absorb (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled strain), nausea, drowsiness (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who predominantly had manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes were responding to the treatment with Aripiprazole, were outweighed against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution for rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were responding to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after beginning or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicidal with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hyperaemia), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (hydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerized and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"(56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events involving with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyuretics, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combined identities, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when using Aripiprazole in combination with alcohol or other centrally potent drugs with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'poor' metabolism, the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the shared gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"once the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor has been removed, the doses of Abilify should be increased to the can height before the start of the adjuvant therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be attributed with a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphic / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (dextromethorphic)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to insufficient data for human safety and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies in animal studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned to operate hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study lasting over 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study lasting over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study lasting over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olantankin therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">"in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% was for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term study lasting over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"enhancements of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy include neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although no information is available on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma retention."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTC receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazl showed a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D, the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, the alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"with the application of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks on healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at Nucleus caudatus and at the putt."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of respondents who adhered to the study medication was similar in both groups (aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values of measured scales, defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depressive rates scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher regression rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olandestine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, 314 patients enrolled and in which the primary study target was" weight gain, "an increase of at least 5.6 kg was observed in significantly fewer patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled Monotherapy studies for over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12 such as lithium and haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar disorder, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyprofiling of Aripiprazl, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The median elimination was approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazl, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients."</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no signs of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal cortex-adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (that is 10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"furthermore, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- aripiprazl no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study about 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility."</seg>

<seg id="301">"since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal connection with these events was established."</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a microtubules substance that promotes the integration of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolysis.</seg>
<seg id="303">"this stabilization leads to a suspension of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cellular functions."</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transzytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminate receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the albuminescent protein acidic rich in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unfaded trials and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">"in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2."</seg>

<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascularly distribution and / or soft tissue binding from paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">"according to the Abraxane application, the clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel application, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%)."</seg>
<seg id="321">"in published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver disease and tissue layers, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3" -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3 "-p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel)."</seg>
<seg id="322">"after a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urethral excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3" -p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearance.

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetal medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be adequately adjusted with metformin alone in the highest acceptable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulphonyl resin or insulin, the current dose of sulphonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of acetone treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulphonyl resin or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes better adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin; in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which indicates that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of acetin and a sulphonyl resin showed a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c values, while the addition of placebo was reduced by 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos increased the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who also took placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypoaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any other component, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">"it was decided that in the frame of a monotherapy (for the sole use), Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated."</seg>
<seg id="762">"in October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Actos in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="763">"the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "15" "and on the other hand the inscription" "Actos". ""</seg>
<seg id="764">"pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficiently regulated with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or incompatibilities (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="765">"no data is available for pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended."</seg>
<seg id="766">"in patients affected by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose."</seg>
<seg id="767">"patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve."</seg>
<seg id="768">"patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macropascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">"this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study."</seg>
<seg id="771">"in patients with elevated liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used."</seg>
<seg id="772">"if the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values can be checked again as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="773">"if a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper abdomen complaints, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme measurements must be checked."</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone is continued should be directed by the clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">"in clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been established, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases related to a fluid retention."</seg>
<seg id="776">"as a result of a hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocoagulation (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with Pioglitazon."</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and haematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">"as a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyluent or as a two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="779">"after the market introduction of Thiazoldindione, including pioglitazone, an appearance or deterioration of diabetic macular edema was reported with a decrease in visual acuity."</seg>
<seg id="780">"it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="781">"in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone"</seg>
<seg id="782">"the calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication."</seg>
<seg id="783">"in the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures observed in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication."</seg>
<seg id="784">"patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6)."</seg>
<seg id="785">"studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="786">"interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blockers and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected."</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicine (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">"often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not appreciated from available data)."</seg>
<seg id="791">"these lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents."</seg>
<seg id="792">"in clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT ascents exceeded the upper limit of the normal range as often as placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea."</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macropascular disease the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon or Pioglitazon was suspected.</seg>
<seg id="794">"since the market launch, it has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="795">"a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with compartimation medications was carried out."</seg>
<seg id="796">"in the ProActive study lasting over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were observed in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication."</seg>
<seg id="797">"when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur."</seg>
<seg id="798">"pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated receptor-γ), which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells."</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilisation in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy continued for two years to study the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">"at the time of two years after the onset of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (over 50% of the patients under Gliclacide)."</seg>
<seg id="802">"in a placebo-controlled study for over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three-month improvement period with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo."</seg>
<seg id="803">"in patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45%, compared to patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed."</seg>
<seg id="804">"in clinical trials for a year, a statistically significant decline of albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values."</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetics in a small study of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">"in most clinical trials, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids as well as a slight increase in HDL- cholesterol levels were observed in most clinical trials, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels."</seg>
<seg id="807">"in clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plastic matrix glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol levels."</seg>
<seg id="808">"compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while metformin and Gliclacide were observed."</seg>
<seg id="809">"in a study lasting more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="810">"in the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macropascular disease were randomised in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="811">"after oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma generally 2 hours after application."</seg>
<seg id="812">"on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="813">"in interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin."</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">"according to the oral application of radioactive Pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%)."</seg>
<seg id="816">"the average plasma-elimination-time of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours."</seg>
<seg id="817">"the plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance of the parent substance are similar."</seg>
<seg id="818">"toxicological studies were performed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated appointment of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia, and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy."</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia resulting from the gestation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) elevated incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>

<seg id="827">"in a study lasting more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, which has an effect on tryphic glyceride absorption and hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="828">"although the study missed the goal of its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, coronary armonary artery and revitrearisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with taking Pioglitazon."</seg>

<seg id="1443">Taking vegetable preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5) is due to possible interactions that may result in a reduction of the tacrolimus hygiene.</seg>

<seg id="1638">"based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP still considered the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="1639">"therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder is supposed to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"in December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited shared the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the transfer of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer."</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"the virus in Advexin is a" Adenovirus, "which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and therefore no infection can trigger in humans."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors, allowing the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein once more."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene contained in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered."</seg>

<seg id="1648">"after the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="1649">"based on the initial submission of the submitted documents, the CHMP requests a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"according to the CHMP, it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni-tumours provides benefits for patients."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient."</seg>

<seg id="1655">"aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of ainaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are disgraded."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms in the last 12 hours were."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was examined, the patients with ainaze showed a relief of 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who alone received desloratadin."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include tachycardia, mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolency (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any other component, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), heart or vascular disease, including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrosis), or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for introducing Aerinaze to the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking them, break or chew)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">"because of the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have dropped.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, ephedrine etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data did not suffice to reach appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>

<seg id="1682">"Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"the harmlessness of the use of ainaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, however, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not give rise to the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans, and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness which may result in impairment of traffic jam or the ability to operate machinery."</seg>

<seg id="1690">"in a single dose study with adults, 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying."</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"the oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further likeeptic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"there were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving ainaze tablets."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"in both studies, the histamine-antagonistic effectiveness of ainaze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the total scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine by the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"in terms of gender, age or ethnicity, the effectiveness of ainaze tablets showed no significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"as part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"according to the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibrium was reached by Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine on day 10."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in the course of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects suffered desloratadin badly."</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine was equivalent to exposure to the administration of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"however, the preclinical data with Desoatadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity and reproductive toxicity."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine."</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"flu pandemic occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from person to person, because people have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as" foreign "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"as a result, the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly in a contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus was removed with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as a foreign body), purified and used as a component of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">"as a result, the scope of clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines."</seg>

<seg id="1917">"in the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under agility together with Ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to patients who continued their protease inhibitors:"</seg>
<seg id="1918">"the most common side effects of Agenase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue."</seg>

<seg id="1920">"Agenase may not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are broken down just like a generase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood."</seg>

<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenase a stronger control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are also recommended."</seg>

<seg id="2035">"the evidence of the effectiveness of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI pre-treated adults (600 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly roamed with low-dose kritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"one hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the partial study A of PRO30017."</seg>

<seg id="2038">"the evidence of the effectiveness of unbiased Agenase is based on two uncontrolled studies with 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI."</seg>

<seg id="2042">"19 Based on this data, treatment optimisation in PI pretreated children should be considered to be the expected benefit of" unbundled "amgenerase."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"after oral administration, the median duration amounts (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"by contrast, 508% increased for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice a day)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"the administration of amprenavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12)."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption."</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound aspirin that represents the active portion probably remains unchanged."</seg>

<seg id="2050">"therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a CYP3A4 substrate must be administered cautiously if they are given concurrently (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily basis exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily."</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative opinion in which the announcement of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C medicine was recommended by alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug-like component that has already been approved in the EU (also known as" "reference medicinal products" ")."</seg>

<seg id="2666">The efficacy of alpheon was compared to 455 patients in the study of hepatitis C patients.</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were voiced that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">"the number of patients with hepatitis C, who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease resumed in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; Alpheon also had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug answers an immune response (i.e. the body makes antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection with a crust formation) and small infected raids (crack or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to be used for treating infections that have been provably or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be applied in patients with age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were considered together with skin wounds, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective in the treatment of abscesses (stained-up cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were provably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most frequent side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the Contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small lazerations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation due to the use of retapamine ointment, the treatment should be broken off, the ointment carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"reapamulin is not intended to be used for treating infections, where MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamines and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations observed in people after topical application on isolated skin or infected superficial wounds (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole, the median retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retaamulin Saline on the skinned skin of healthy adult men."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not required if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">"retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamines is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"when deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued, the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman is to weigh."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied Altargo, the most reported side-effect irritation was at the administration place, which concerned about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance produced by fermentation of Clitopilus passagerianus (formerly Pleurotus passagerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibitory of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50 sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptide transfer center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, block partial P binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should the local prevalence of resistance apply to the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms, advice should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamines compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as panton-valentine leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retaamulin Saline was applied to intact and isolated skin for up to 7 days."</seg>
<seg id="2706">"in 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% Retaamulin Saline twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondarily infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients either before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic intake in people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skinned skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP-inhibiting."</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro antioxidant metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in trials of oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years of age that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses and a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">"therefore, Ambix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be completed."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a riser dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">"vaccines act by helping the immune system (the natural defences of the body)" "teach" "how it can defend itself against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" foreign "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambix contains the same ingredients as the immunized vaccination of Twinrix adults, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccines that have been approved since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambix and Twinrix are included adults identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month interval between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambix conducted between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody levels for hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matiness (tiredness) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients or any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">"in August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a licence for Ambirix's placing on the market"</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standardization plan for priming with Ambirix is made up of two doses, the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a refresher is requested for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccine, need a refresher as protection as they may also be protected by immunological memory even with no longer detectable antibodies."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all vaccines, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine, appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of haemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value is achieved after priming, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines can be required."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal success, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"however, for thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambix can be injected subcutaneously as it can lead to bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"if Ambirix was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"in patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternal symptoms, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in former Thiomerase and preservative-containing vaccine formulations."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm, or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot work insulin, Apidra studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin delivery was determined after six months."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human regular insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisine or any other ingredient or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneously through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and diminished insulin release, the insulin requirement in patients can be reduced with a limitation of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change in effect, the brand (manufacturers), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinklag, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dose or breakdown of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">A patient's switching to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the extent of the insulin used and can therefore change when switching the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the symptoms of the adrenergic counterregulation should be weakened or missing under the influence of sympathies such as betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into breast milk nor is it resorbed to oral use."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"lipodystrophy Applies to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, as a result a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a trained person, or by intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glucosal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the subcutaneous GA- be of isinglulisin the effect occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mli- tus, insulin lulisin showed a proportional glucosal effect in the therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandial glycaemic control is reached as with a human regular insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"in 2 minutes before the meal, insulin lulisin was obtained, a better postkeratal control was achieved than with a human regular insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control as with a human regular insulin which is given 2 mids before the meal is reached (see Figure 1)."</seg>
