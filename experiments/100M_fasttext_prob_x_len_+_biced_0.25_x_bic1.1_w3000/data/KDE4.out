&quot; the module website can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras &apos;s Website . select from the drop @-@ down list , select the source and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire &amp; URL ; &quot;
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore the translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation before .
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can directly insert texts to be translated . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting extensions .... Open the map tools and select the desired modules there . &quot;
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the module feeder filters ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with Extras View Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different way .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as a pres@@ et , the ad starts with the root node of the document , for example : all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected if they are far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either be depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle should occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . frames are drawn to display the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame requires space which is then no longer available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; as distribution of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation remains up to the implementation . in this context , it is always prefer@@ able to divide the surfaces in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ rent divisions . &quot;
&quot; instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the or@@ derly entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you access the Picture Gallery module , a dialog box opens , which allows you to specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the Picture Gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line option has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .

&quot; to include sub@@ folders with the check box , you can set up with a slide controller or a script to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the original pictures , copy the original pictures to the gallery to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the comment file check box , you can enter a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box with your own color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , review and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image plu@@ gins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , dozens of professional skills are available . it works fully in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of end users , so you should report any problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; when you are in the program , the Help menu will report an entry problems or requests .... This will open a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ board ; visit homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; when you are editing &amp; editing ; for the first time run , you will be asked where you want to save your images and database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your host . here , the data file is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; in addition , you will use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; viewed every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed while browsing the folder , you will see a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders , unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can you do ex@@ tr@@ bs &amp; digi@@ kam , by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ign have no photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and taking it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera , and then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it can be edited ; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the computer the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realised via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plu@@ gins Interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ Cont@@ acts and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function , when the changes are made in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or another application window . the only limitation is that an image can not be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common types : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter on the file name only works if this ind it symbol view is also displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right click on the album and select the album properties menu in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorting by Date .
&quot; buttons elder , average , new : these set the date to the oldest , newest picture or section of the album . to this end , the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information is first tried . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first select an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Add as album preview &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My cue list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be displayed in the picture window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can help you avoid using the preview images in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are , you can edit via Settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor hold a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the Intro@@ duction in the main window shows such help window .
&quot; photos are all what it was about &amp; digi@@ kam ; goes . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to them . you can choose all the functions that have been edited with &amp; edited ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button , and editing ... . in the editing section you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the image processing , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . to do this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; del@@ eting , it is moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My date limit ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date , or if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so , you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ aison , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; &quot; ; or click an existing keyword and then select New cue . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ t@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then , a menu appears that gives you the option to move the cue . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting the keyword in the contex@@ tual menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you want to provide with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &quot; . &quot; alternatively , you can also select with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and assign them from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a cue for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was done etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a picture with keywords , it will appear under the thumb@@ nail preview in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box that indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection , which then appears in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; ne@@ end er Such@@ box is a small lamp that gets green when the search matches hits . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you will get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filtering what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit search , the search form will appear with the search information previously entered . if you select as expanded search , the search dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . further information can be found in the section &quot; &quot; The Tool for Advanced Search &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select from the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . all rules are added or deleted by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be combined with others through the logical operations All ... , A ... , N@@ one ... or At least ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; each image characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from anywhere above the icon of an in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : hands @-@ free sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . you can also set a threshold value here .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ ary in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The lighting table will be added from the context menu . the selection is added to the table and its window will be opened . if you are back in &amp; Out ; main window , you can quickly open the table with L Extras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and drop there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible . if you select preview syn@@ cing from the tool@@ bar and perform zo@@ oming operations on one of the pictures , then these are also executed at the other image . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you want to navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the parts . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal delete actions also work directly out of the table , such as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ ary . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible part of the picture , you need to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
zoom in the same way as in other views . just use the Zoom @-@ knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are comparing in the preview mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the picture has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , scans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , summari@@ ze , optimize , maintain , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; metadata is defined as data about data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly via your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a web page . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend to save the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign every picture , words , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos in the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call with other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you bz@@ w to paste the pictures to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata is over@@ hau@@ led . this is a very rough representation , since every block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to get in touch with your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even gives you a spell ch@@ ecker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it earth a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually recre@@ ate your journeys using images with geographic indications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can no longer be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be the title of a photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mark on the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to others . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk failures , disk failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , dis@@ sem@@ ination of super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kind of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section deals with problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you may not be trusted for more than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . &quot;
CD / DVD discs can become un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more depend@@ able .
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this solid protection they age by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said about CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ othe@@ ques retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of errors , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors found by S@@ MA@@ RT announce the imminent failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be produced without major problems . &quot;
&quot; on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards , and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result of loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . however , it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well as this can achieve over@@ voltage . some manufacturers offer over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system arranged . if you buy an U@@ PS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the costs of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can bind it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are disaster safe . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs , at least , ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have one day to open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed . no one seems ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % on workplace systems . in lap@@ tops , the percentage of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time , no one has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras &quot; sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit . &quot;
&quot; even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . therefore , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or changing the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash struck you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time on which such backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system except that it is locked and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retain original memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way than to for@@ ego a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the fewer variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means getting bigger .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and have placed the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new disk was recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; size of the disk in MB@@ az ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ db ; &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create them yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . &quot;
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . a problem however is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG is a licence @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the image formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already using D@@ NG and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon even sometime .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original of your shot , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP is suitable as it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera editor , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the addition of a photos to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . with some cameras , it might take a while . if the connection is made , a fer@@ vent indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos are displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufactur@@ er@@ notices , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the Met@@ adata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata isn &apos;t available with some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from your camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . during downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the selected button . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this feature , an option New Download is available . these images have not been downloaded yet . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed , like normal folders sorted , displayed . the list of existing albums is displayed , like normal folders , displayed . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete all delete button . if you only want to delete some , then you must select them first and then delete Del@@ ete selected . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos are not deleted in the cases of &amp; k@@ de ; they should be carefully checked before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera finder , you should do this through the camera menu , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate file names , if you download photos from different recording sets in the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer open three further options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the standard authentication part . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the Pre@@ fix fot@@ o- or Y@@ - % % d % H % H : % M : % S in the edit field . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the option camera file names , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you next time you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic turn while downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information on the date the photo was made , you can use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . these sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . to do so , use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then , select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude , which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code ; users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that there are many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . the question is actually more , how the data comes into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transferring data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module . &quot;
&quot; there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the identi@@ fiers ha@@ iry coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you as much control over your work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to edit in the Settings menu ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing , so you create the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should include the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . this ensures that metadata is permanently contained in the image , and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; edited ; import without losing . &quot;
save image let@@ tering as embedded ann@@ ot@@ ations ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
&quot; the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions ; ignored ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; when you open the lamp , these settings will be enabled if enabled . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data takes more time to expand and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TI@@ FF files option , you can comp@@ ress the def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files can save you los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently it is fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this option is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top @-@ lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the sky@@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to look through the sky@@ lights . use the setting throughout white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results , as it shows the pointed lights in various pink tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still unused blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when selecting the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing down , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the part raw data that many cameras have , and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces however color arti@@ facts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction , since it is performed during the raw conversion process . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; folder @-@ folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color tones mapping or g@@ amma correc@@ tions . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you can print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manual corrected , rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the finish : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will then be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short instructions for tasks carried out by modules can be set in the menu under &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / XP , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option &quot; &quot; confirmation dialog &quot; &quot; for moving &gt; images in the garbage bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and er@@ ase an album . &quot;
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be sil@@ ently edited ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without asking questions . otherwise you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
&quot; you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; at startup , this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; setting the Start after new photos obli@@ ges &amp; digi@@ kam ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you if it should delete them from the database . &quot;
&quot; various color schemes can be edited &amp; edited ; to adjust the main window to your taste , you can select these settings in Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below : &quot;
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find further information in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry ads / Edit .
&quot; image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see section Image Processing . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can not restore the original photo once you have saved the picture . &quot;
you should therefore create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or using the button &quot; Rest@@ ore the image processing &quot; in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
virtually any image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Ret@@ ail@@ ers from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the resume button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : automatically select magni@@ fication factor &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . usually , you can change this in the presentation dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ kam type ; see the section for setting image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print the picture in the File menu and receive the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Prin@@ ter dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sentences . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods , and select from the menu album Export job super@@ visor . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
&quot; the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ h@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should note these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the application button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the rating section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field Ur@@ gency . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword function displays a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this &amp; edited ; session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword . you can restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief for typing blan@@ ks in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image rather than the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the topic keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keywords filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the above example , the main window displays the images at a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it would have to be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that has already been placed in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an advanced search using all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner are a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are like those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web are similar to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is on color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your other image output is by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to bri@@ be my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to bri@@ be your monitor , since s@@ RGB results from your ; on@@ itor &apos;s RGB mode works . if you work as the RGB colour space , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , comparing , automatic trimm@@ ing and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correc@@ tions attempt automatically to make your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the brightness values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed away .
&quot; same : this method uses the brightness re@@ actor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic trimm@@ ing : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
aug@@ menting Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a re @-@ adjustment of all values in between . this is only visible in well @-@ balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is used . if you can thus far from the original image can be removed , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
thumb@@ nail preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; the hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the Shadow Adju@@ st@@ ment allows you to improve or di@@ gest the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly that . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file , and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats . &quot;
this tool will open the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color tones mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ windows for brightness . a detailed guidance for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter ink management .
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for several photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error , so you always need the same correction . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; the coloured , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier from the additional light . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar cell . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is possible chem@@ ically . finally , another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ oth ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , he beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . you can view all your settings in preview .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one to large satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple ch@@ id strength / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ er correction is located for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the knob and make sure the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is often the most useful . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top one for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ks can be used in preview the original image to adjust the input of shadows , medium and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values permit the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input ratings . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save and load : with these buttons , the default values in the file system can be saved and loaded again . to this end , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; use the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the entries of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be shown . previ@@ ew@@ ing will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is usually the most meaningful one . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; to preview the original photos is to see a red marker . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; set the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if pixels are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shad@@ ings of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison of one &apos;s own rider . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the color @-@ noise . color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour noise first . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . for any mixer setting , you can save it later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . preserving the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic ec@@ lip@@ tic effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film direction with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : generates warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ears . this is very similar to the process of ex@@ changing a pressure and re@@ development in a se@@ pi@@ racy . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ qu@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; add tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stra@@ y eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . all the way round the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a bon@@ net effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this is also possible in multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool template , you can put a template on a picture . &quot;
applying the Picture Tem@@ plate menu in image processing can be used to put templates across a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil , please send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings are noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position . &quot;
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the preview size . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ness is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it is created especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ audiovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust . &quot;
the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera has often been used for internal sharpen@@ ing . however , images in raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a sharpen@@ ing filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this can be done with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ting Do@@ or . &quot;
&quot; however , you should handle this carefully as the results do not work very naturally : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image intensi@@ fies the tool . under re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft character and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter Un@@ clearly mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview will help you edit the picture . the preview window will show the filter output with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the sharp@@ est mask to strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will create near blur@@ red edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius turns a like many pixels on each side of an edge being affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a frac@@ ture from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ming . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a blur@@ red mask .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixels , which causes unwanted results in most cases . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter to use this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can assume values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness is Gau@@ ß . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in matri@@ ces size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module , before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , blur@@ red Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by blur@@ red Mas@@ quer@@ ade a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in theory , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the sharp@@ est mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original blur@@ red color pattern needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ s the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the rest@@ au@@ ration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction depen@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; directional depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is fl@@ atten@@ ed to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD imaging , a high value will create wa@@ vy @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed from 1 value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; angle range da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long term . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral incre@@ ment width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral incre@@ ment in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel @-@ smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality that you receive by selecting this option is only modest , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it out . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are doing exactly that . correc@@ ting any image errors can be saved in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected visual below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove sta@@ ins and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny h@@ iss that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings sub @-@ window can remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller bugs are cleared . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing of the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or for@@ ging happens again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can &apos;t remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance density of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the image through the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the image controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma resonance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other , if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove sta@@ ins and is the recommended method . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten the image and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grains , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
the text texture is developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly that . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file , and loaded again later . &quot;
&quot; photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop . &quot;
&quot; the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie poster on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) , and the corrected below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example of photo restoration . this time texture is reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected visual below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project that are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixel . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the Dark Picture button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the results within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , in particular those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise blur@@ red effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can check the vi@@ gn@@ ette filter filter and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which means an optical filter with a lens aper@@ ture of 1 , or random@@ ly a brightness of 2 , reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fla@@ ws at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth gra@@ dient correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value controls the strength of distortion of the second gra@@ dient . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter &apos; General &apos; . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ ets the image size and thus correc@@ ts the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
ligh@@ ten : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the key or cushion distortion should be performed before any changes or size changes . the best way to do this is to perform this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ like correction , the effect would be apparent fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the bottom of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu Edit cutting from image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected visual below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate Infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for previ@@ ew@@ ing . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add Movie Gran@@ t if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ controller changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top @-@ lights .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the footage gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image will get rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited version ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth controls the smooth@@ ing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size image is 1 and smooth@@ ing 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity graph@@ s to create a carbon cap . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . these would be good pictures to start . &quot;
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving determines your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter En@@ grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ ious landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows setting the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving fil@@ e. the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and makes it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of blocks of glass .
some effects take a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ red blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the image and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects take a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of dro@@ pl@@ ets .
&quot; you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to choose the range , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you start the filter rain drops , the range will remain free of rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the correct orientation by mirr@@ oring or rotating . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ers Dre@@ aming or transforming mirrors . &quot;
blown up photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you blow an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation , for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a more developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph@@ ing photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available on tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Store buttons are used for this purpose . each st@@ abling of photo can be zo@@ omed as a text file , and can be rel@@ o@@ aded later . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply plu@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cut , use the &quot; &quot; C@@ tr@@ l &quot; &quot; button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically centre the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area to cut to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the edit tool next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the help aid enable you to hide help , so that you can put together your images better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle into a similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden center : the golden center is a division that refers to different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . &quot;
the golden center provides more fluid help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is cent@@ red in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without guiding the eye , it will fulfill its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral covered above . its cus@@ pi@@ ds are the centre @-@ points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to pla@@ ge a static object more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal Options horizont@@ ally and vertically can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
&quot; with the Color button you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current picture . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it happens easily that you keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . &quot;
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are shown in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to zero . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right @-@ hand side .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation becomes a horizontal and a vertical line . move the cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after turning a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting out of image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally trim function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image is lubri@@ cated a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you adjust the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former trimm@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part in the opposite direction . a horizontal screening , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image becomes distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; you can narrow your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can create horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press Pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two form@@ ulations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with trans@@ former trimm@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done based on the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file will be edited ; you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supporting cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to launch the program to play .

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description follows here .
&quot; use a unified dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; the upper section shows the original , and the lower part shows the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters during shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom out or move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the Pal@@ ettes files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described in the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box of the cur@@ sor is enabled under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the modus over@@ write is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; edit &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character if another color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ector can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ ene . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are out@@ dated by the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ master viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ and@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ liter@@ al ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or the graph in &amp; k@@ and@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ Gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . at first , if you start &amp; k@@ gra@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty like in the bottom of the screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; quot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; k@@ bar@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ s@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you are using several pages , you can choose whether the sections of the graph that come to a page will be adapted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page preview with a graph , distributed on several pages without header and with a different font &quot;
&quot; the Renew@@ able Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the Open site gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ f@@ viewer , when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested . &quot;
the session management page gives you the ability to set the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ f@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be prompted for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up more possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces representations according to the boun@@ ce spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ cing spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ cht@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice to treat large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
&quot; &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular manner according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that runs from a shell . the command should accept the graph file as parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can select &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithm to change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; geared towards &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) .
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse po@@ inter . click a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source file &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ master ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you will find further options in the Settings menu .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid net in which you draw the icon . &quot;
&quot; create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog will appear in which you can choose whether to create the icon from a template , or if you want to start anew from scratch . &quot;
&quot; re@@ stores the last revers@@ ed step . if you did not make any step backward , this function is disabled . &quot;

sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not correspond to those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ; .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the dot you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing space , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background , and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel or display rulers and set one color : or a chess board as a transparency display . you can also set the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Groß , as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or any other source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item Images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default value duc@@ er to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings might not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the Scan button , wait until the scan is complete and the image window appears . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . here you can also select the compression and type of the image file . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Import @-@ &gt; Screen Photo menu . a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work place . if you have checked the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other areas of work , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialogue options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send your photos to the people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world showing pictures of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for authentication , so it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . for upload , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add images should be pressed once after you have set all other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading images to Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
&quot; the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words , which will be added to the image as keywords while up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above dialog appears then . to get a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . set your camera line here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have track data from a location for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog moves the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set up with the displayed map . to do this , select the region in question and increase it . the height must always be selected manually . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization possible .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums you want to export . the albums will not be displayed hierarch@@ ically . the three buttons on the right will show you a large number of albums . in the area below the preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
&quot; the tab design@@ ates the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will appear directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have read permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are shown in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short @-@ screen commands and m@@ aus@@ ing . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot;
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any destination format . JPEG is supported by writing . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can use the MPEG slide show to launch the module . &quot;
&quot; the images you select are then listed in the image files in the Portfolio , where you can also change the images or contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as much as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button Co@@ ding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or calm@@ ly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages above the button settings at the bottom . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! . &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file which should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with previ@@ ew@@ ing , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame will remain the same , and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently , or to continue using them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . however , this is useful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . further pictures can draw on the list of pictures to send and place them there .
&quot; after you have started the module , the image window will be shown with the images you have selected . you can add more images with a file selection dialog via the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview is shown on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and store them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; to remove images , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the New News window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are attached as attachments . &quot;
most email accounts have limitations to the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG file format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted from los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your email program will , however , be automatically started at the end . with the closing button , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window appears with questions like you want to have your slide show displayed . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL Transi@@ tions option in the presentation will enable very elegant picture transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you will need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the option File name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while presentation .
&quot; the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . afterwards , you can break down manually with Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; the option of random@@ ly choosing images ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not the order of the images used in the album . &quot;
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot;
&quot; there are more than a dozen transition effects that you can choose between . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect . &quot;
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date still has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module implements the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture below . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images by name , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can choose which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you need to open the image preview window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the Search button in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for displaying the image properties . you can view this dialog once again . &quot;
&quot; you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here you can see images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the User Manual for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album &apos;s homepage , and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for the first time start or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; try .
&quot; if you prefer to print out this manual , you can find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . you can see a picture of this bar here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the thumb@@ nail viewed from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview window ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview window . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of that period in the preview window . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; introduces two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the menu File ...
&quot; before HTML pages are created , you need to set some settings . these are divided into the three sections Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the overview and a description , which the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ Photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this way you can avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800@@ x@@ 600 may not download images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; for all your HTML files , select a base folder and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them to it . thus , the import function , see , correctly functions , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings you have just described have all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your images with them . you can of course create an HTML page to view the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from File Explorer ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access through the File ... Export menu . &quot;
the most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; in the manual copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
with option Automati@@ cally close to .@@ k@@ im file Cop@@ y &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maxim@@ ized image size . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu , select &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you will person@@ alize the category of persons belonging to the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called persons . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file to be imported and which categories these are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported into the categories of your current database . for example , see the image . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will follow the various steps from ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , through ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; saves all of its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and used it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
the menu entry Settings k@@ Photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual you will explain the different settings .
&quot; to the left you can see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can define different properties , such as people , places and keywords for each picture . you can also create your own groups , such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; click on the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up entire member groups , e.g. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; share its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the module yourself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of several applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; therefore you should always test new modules first with the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications using the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules work with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order for albums so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; thus simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you have defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category of people , you will do &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so , so if you have chosen people to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate every picture with comments . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; because you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be displayed , so that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign the persons more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol by date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each picture separately , you may still want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are below the preview of the picture above . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , you see a browser window showing the USA as a group . to show you that this is a group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories in alphabetical order . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and post@@ p@@ one the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also create your own window from a frame , by moving it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... , which allows you , among other things , the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you have no filter set . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply clicking down the mouse with the middle mouse button , simply try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit Select in the Edit menu . now the window appears that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use it with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can also use images somewhere without saving you on the hard drive . of course you need to record the images somewhere so that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is truncated , are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so you can view the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; so if you want to avoid the confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard disk to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the Images menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those that you may want to make accessible to others and click Ac@@ tual View All except the current view block . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images to be hidden . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this photo protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course , that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in it . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered about the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down . you can skip to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slides . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . as often as a new picture loads it can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom out , you can easily pull a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the power button , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to one pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos function in and out with the plus and sub @-@ key .
you can rotate the picture using the context menu of the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
&quot; if you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to set on the picture . at the moment you can view the preview and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to preview only the image and look at more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; once you have set out features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so if you print , print or whatever you choose , simply copy them all at once . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the characters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow you &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture . &quot;
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later . &quot;
&quot; in order to enable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object displayed in the wire model views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the paste menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will appear , so you can select the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete either from the Edit menu bar or from the right @-@ click context menu , select previously selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Apply to take over these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a pres@@ et , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render just a part of the texture ( e.g. a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
&quot; the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot;
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level of the scene selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also save several window orders and easily switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , pull the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tab card at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to remove a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any position . &quot;
you can save the current window view with View window arrangement ... Save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement using an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering the icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene render . &quot;
&quot; render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render @-@ settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to see the features of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render just a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the quality combination you can choose Properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling meets the adjacent pixels . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixel is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are separately tra@@ cked and checked for further sub@@ division . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last adjustment for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection comp@@ utes . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams do not have an object .
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly ended , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
to import one &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the menu item file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in Property View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder &apos;s folder , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type license plate .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section , it will explain how to create and save window orders . &quot;
standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected order with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
&quot; new column will create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing windows , with un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with tab@@ s you get a map view view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a ball at a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not include light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following default window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial first , you must remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now includes a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera find . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you press the Apply or button button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert fin@@ ite body qu@@ aders ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply or En@@ ter button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , if at the moment only as a limited final level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are a lot of different materials , but choose a few times at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens where you can select how to insert the object . please select First Sub object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pigment preview shows only a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pig@@ ments . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see color on the header and sphere in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set correctly now . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list , you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select single @-@ coloured and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should be easy to execute , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the button or apply the button ) , so the ball will ho@@ ver over the floor , since you have shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select First Sub object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on the pigment , then select Uni@@ color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or push the input button .
&quot; the brightness @-@ effect and reflection settings give already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ mod@@ eler offers . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene you want to be row@@ ed needs some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
re@@ produces the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command revers@@ ed . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edi@@ ting undo .
saves the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cut and default behavior . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . with this option , you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; change commands or add new ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool@@ icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; add and remove commands . &quot;
&quot; a B@@ ump Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without need@@ ing to individually model any b@@ ump on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
&quot; basic elements are simple geomet@@ rical forms , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel based using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set , if any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then , a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Box - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set . in the two other , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can adjust further down . pres@@ et is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder while you are still viewing the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , Stor@@ ks &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background with the selected color is also filled . &quot;
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed that can also display the program .
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam project ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and carry out correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; show@@ photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains reports about problems or requests . this will display a dialog with a link . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&quot; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo , we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings , you must select the show@@ photo menu in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s : &quot;
&amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that don &apos;t do any more than scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer does than scan and save images . for each image , you can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images prior to saving . &quot;
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; outputs ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings also contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not cover these options .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving previ@@ ew@@ ing in the settings before saving , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and the lie ? en will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the kind as &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save As option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as a default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ... &quot;
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; lin@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; output ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; chan@@ g@@ ite ; to quit .

&quot; you can set up a list of these cuts and their function below . you can set up the global keyboard short@@ cut by right @-@ clicking on the player window , and selecting &quot; &quot; Set key short@@ cuts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you can set any existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function epr@@ int might look like : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some command line options .
&quot; you should give feedback to the user if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script to see if all required modules are available and use a dialog , so the user knows why a script is not running . &quot;

&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the alignment data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder onto the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed to remove the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ ress@@ Sam@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script pack@@ ets that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally be comp@@ acted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the extension amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets right away . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file per@@ missions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can go to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts side of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you will find just a specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; you might already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if the choice is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no difficulty comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the System Pre@@ ferences section for details . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be setup effort@@ lessly through the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches off the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , this will change the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
tuning files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled . mood files are stored in the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; when you want to save the playlist , the current playlist will automatically save you when you end &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be stored . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep the current piece visible when changing a piece , the playlist window is set up / down to keep the running piece always visible in the visible range of windows . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , the context browser automatically switches to the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adapt &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set by checking your own fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey section is enabled . you can choose fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . &quot;
&quot; by selecting Custom color scheme , you have even the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . for this purpose , use the color sel@@ ections activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
resume play starts at the start that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the play continues automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
&quot; the On @-@ Screen @-@ Display sub@@ window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces will open the dialog box for color sel@@ ections . if original colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can define on which screen a multi @-@ screen environment should appear the O@@ SD . &quot;
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this map .
&quot; the collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection . &quot;
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up , how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; recur@@ sively search sub @-@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok , both the rou@@ gh@@ ened and their sub@@ folders to music can be searched . &quot;
&quot; monitoring changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another device in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then you enter the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the cardboard box last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if needed .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
recall similar pieces : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers will be called to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to make k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager plays the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .@@ or@@ g. Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can find a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can find the file by ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of the time this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes while editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ . disable if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically when crashing ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ Infos , but don &apos;t mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random@@ ness mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects can be easily forgotten . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ fold &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
to fix this error you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are most easily solved by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also look for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only enter a bug there if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces enter there ? &quot;
&quot; this is easy . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the launch pad has been converted to the Statisti@@ cs window . you can find it under Extras &apos;s Statisti@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Display Review . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and select Rem@@ ove Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist and let it drop there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is located . click on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably miss the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar at Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be : which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 player , input button &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously display audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide a different spr@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; it does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning : see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the fewer the visu@@ al@@ isations do . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all of the components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the IR@@ C Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( end Amar@@ ok first ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg file , compile and install it . then go to the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer for all the m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with the following @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and restart the startup script . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar application and run this command with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets you start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current title when you &apos;re on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ p d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable username Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
&quot; the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . to do so , press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence in queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n button ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , change to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can add a review for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece exactly as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialogue . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select setting tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text @-@ browser design , click New Design .... &quot;
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the kon@@ quer@@ or , start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select the Add Amar@@ ok drop down menu ; &quot;
audi@@ os@@ c@@ ranked is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
&quot; probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you install x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install . &quot;
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module must also have the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module installed . &quot;
they get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ e type audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator register . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can you use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok set up ... Audio output you enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } ch@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on the sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio @-@ output with Arts is not supported . you can of course take this problem yourself ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed advisor for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection makes it easy to search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it by clicking the playlist of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own playlist , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in your collection folders , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD tracks in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD feature uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
&quot; the Bur@@ n function is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry , and follow the Bur@@ n menu . you have several options for burning a CD here . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make pleasant .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep track of your music collection . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display that displays the currently running piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Player window includes a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by right @-@ clicking on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also available . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the Play@@ list window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you ; they are all easy to use .
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows will be explained in detail later . they provide information about the current piece on different aspects . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window will have fallen off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; also , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( extras Statisti@@ cs ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; in order to display covers images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recommen@@ ded Parts , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right click somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
&quot; you can click on all the pieces in each area to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it , and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database .
button Search opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com based on the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - At first the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and below it is a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to view compil@@ ations or Sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list in Mis@@ cell@@ aneous performers . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist is ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be listed first by genre , among them by artist . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings for the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change anything at the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , it might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view , as well as in the tree view . critics concerning the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the search filter includes a selection box , with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time windows , from the last 24 hours up to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This will empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set the pieces in queu@@ es - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will make you play next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / write to CD - D@@ ue the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be shown . &quot;
&quot; edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information , and let the tags change for one or more pieces . &quot;
&quot; ( n ) To move files to the garbage dump ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
mark the selection - Select the selected album as a compilation and it appears in different performers .
undo the compilation @-@ mark - Change a selected album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be shown under different performers but again under the corresponding artist .
&quot; the playlist browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Smart Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
you can also add Smart Play@@ lists yourself . click on Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( eg . iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , you need to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Artist . if you are done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL . if you want to enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping them . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert the drop @-@ down files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all of the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; if you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all the pieces contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries found by Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this searches for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bad .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries then receive a lab@@ eling with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . to the right you will find the playlist , empty playlist , and toll mixing . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore , so you can rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that , which you can see in the Player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and choosing tool@@ bars there ... &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . to do so you can disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok via this menu . &quot;
&quot; a click on this entry will open the visualization plug @-@ ins window , where you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; behind this entry , there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover management . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in queue , the playlist appears in the list , in the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ specified ( the details to set up these will follow later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , and add more random pieces during playback . &quot;
adds tracks based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist will work .
&quot; double @-@ click on the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and playlist @-@ mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add at least one piece from your collection . the desired pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;

&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while setting the play@@ able pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces played , which should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing playlist and smart play@@ lists . if you want to cross multiple play@@ lists , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random items from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed . &quot;

O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patent free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder and En@@ co@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG @-@ 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder capable of competing in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 @-@ enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; for example , with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .

&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : an auth@@ ored auth@@ oring system featured in the range of functions for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool can be useful for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will play differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
&quot; saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written . otherwise , a new file name will be asked . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save .

includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen with it as if you were called for any project file closing .
closes all open projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called the closing file .
&quot; when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you merge the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added to the base folder of the CD will appear . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can set many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by what is that ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session are merged into the current project . this is useful for you , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium . &quot;
&quot; this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; it opens the CD @-@ Cop@@ y dialog . it also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD that you can then burn at some time later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; it opens the DVD Cop@@ y Di@@ alogue . it also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn at some time later . also , the copying / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying the source is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the contents will be completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then immediately be burned by pressing the Bur@@ n button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Bur@@ n button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and trimm@@ ing black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the submitted media . this information is displayed in the content view and includes the properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is ti@@ cked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the media . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ strip is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ strip has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ect@@ view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function instantly . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so it is more your taste and the type of task that the accompanying programs give you the preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you will use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) void wi@@ v@@ d ( ) void wi@@ v@@ d ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; this makes it possible to fill in a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and saved in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on the hard disk ) and many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these .@@ wa@@ v files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) , and more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ ch Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not circum@@ vent the protection , it is not possible to use copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can often be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , all manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD data is started according to the request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the Code Settings tab in the setup directory - coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read out as the default . &quot;
&quot; open the file manager , so that an already read file will be selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read out and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pic@@ s ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; terminated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog box of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ ders , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here , you must go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; gre@@ ek &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common among audio formats that lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG easily lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces and has already high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = click of a button in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translation : this is meant by the author ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from being har@@ med by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the system installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror @-@ server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirr@@ ored servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; into wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; in the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the enco@@ der tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , more information can be obtained via its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , read and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine , as it is not considered completely free software . &quot;
make sure the directory is / usr / share / cd and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once , and &quot;
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card general settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only if you request incomplete information , you will be informed if information is missing to generate keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
&quot; the second selection panel is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; tags and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data enquiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror @-@ server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , however , as many fire@@ walls record the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneously reading tracks : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at a time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , please tick this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget that folder if you want to do something yourself with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry to limit the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : at a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a wa@@ v file at the same time .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a default for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and set up the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk . first , a connection to the internet is established , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; as we use one &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , like in the screen@@ shot . this is only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , search in the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window opens , and you can select the database entry that matches your opinion the best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for the automatic request of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least for what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this option is set on the Code Settings tab . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; click on the next line in the main window , and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; &quot;
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the BO@@ M .
&quot; note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ ec@@ es button at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; when clicking on the button Select the reading process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what runs . &quot;
&quot; click on the Ri@@ der orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the tool@@ bar buttons . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read out on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you can see this error when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that can be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading out and coding . for low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is written in the line queue . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the top left corner of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions however already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is aimed at people compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e how to go on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot;
what is it all about ? who reads this probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot keep this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; may it do . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you &apos;ve managed to fetch the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , he has no real @-@ time graphics and a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts even some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound Project driver that is needed for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; when you play &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid ki@@ cks off with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and driving down and forth using the slider . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the speed display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a push on the button pause or selecting the button pause in the menu item , then interrup@@ ts playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events should be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which a song is used , so that you do not need to set anything manually . so , if you select the entry Automatic text selection in the Settings menu , you will still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type firmly , select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can put together . in this section , you will find how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ising .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then add the name for the new collection . this collection will initially contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the per@@ missions in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . consider that if you add lots of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add . it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the Kara@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song button , the next song from the piece menu or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the previous piece button , the entry Pre@@ vious piece from the menu piece or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required conver@@ sions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
def@@ ect@@ PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the note with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun signal ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun signal . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; means that each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; keywords are used , above all , to map sounds on the percussion channel . see the provided key@@ map as an example . &quot;
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel that is shown on the Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that try to change the patch on this channel will always be ignored . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio will indicate in which pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event sends a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM is preten@@ ding that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are currently being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) two different views to display the sounds played . in the Settings menu , select the channel view settings : &quot;
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; OK , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow keys on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI Fol@@ der and &amp; K@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) I only need to change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file only quickly without adding it to a collection , disable automatic addition to collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all of them send me a postcard or MIDI file , but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might already have the file . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and I don &apos;t get money from anyone else . I would like to emphasize that I only keep on programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even just a supporting email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians in the network , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; so on . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ SE@@ U@@ AL . it runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that only appears when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the play begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current items &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this by editing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to choose the play@@ lists from the menu , choose either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the working mode is left or another group is selected without comparing with the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / Un@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start @-@ ups does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end of the animation , so the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the viewing of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; smil@@ ey ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c , like the setup of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash can be played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the custom field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as service provider for the application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . the started process is called pop layer . if there are no errors , check back output inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( View , Con@@ sole , or Con@@ sole from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back end for a certain mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either by means of M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the settings can be found in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be found ports from which one is selected . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ Resource . if enabled , start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after the device has been installed . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for its performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; -@@ distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made . &quot;

&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ comp@@ uted , the body starts with the \ \ begin { document } command and must be closed with the \ \ beginning { document } command . &quot;
the Quick Start Ass@@ ist by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document .
&quot; document categories : this introduces the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scroll &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
encoding : this will set the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for proper processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .

&quot; automatic execution of the environment will create a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to lock the command ( e.g. , \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file was created , skip &amp; skip ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information such as the font and , besides PDF , is the output art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as it was cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the DVI ; viewer is jumped . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is expanded to be &quot; &quot; outer wa@@ xy &quot; &quot; and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the sel@@ ector Other is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes , or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; description : this command will create a name for a section , an image or a different element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a designated term ( selection possible on a selection field ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . it is possible to specify the font sizes for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the \ \ &apos; command command contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the quick construction of the button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; the storage will automatically execute .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if you use quick construction , you should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed . &quot;
&quot; an environment is a text that is handled differently from the rest of the document . if , for example , a report with the font size e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } may then allow to change the font size inside the environment . &quot;
changes are only covered within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold type , itali@@ c pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { tem@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language has been presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in fat and itali@@ c pressure and a poem are used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is a popular file format ( limited . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , converting into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this only Modern under Settings box needs to be set up ... tools for building will be selected .
&quot; to perform the pre @-@ selection , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on prior search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then eff@@ ected . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ay ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Docum@@ ent the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and set to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( setting the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if you do not open the &amp; DVI file , an error may be present . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window briefly . &quot;
&quot; the log file lists the source code in the source code . in the editor , the pop@@ up La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between errors . in order to view the error line , the error must be cli@@ cked in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; navig@@ ating to the defective line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the respective button in the tool@@ bar is cli@@ cked , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re @-@ written or used by the wizard for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , please refer to the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings general will be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are to be replaced by what variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by the entry into the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Tut@@ orial &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps are required : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the default ones . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files created . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and browse the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn his options , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with a &lt; C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that when you click \ \ par for \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left mouse button , the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board automatically . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the different kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional jumping trademarks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items edit jump marks or the respective button mouse makes the jump to the next or last jump brand . thereby , this jump brand is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
editing is probably one of the key aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; kate ; already outstanding options have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; Source Tex@@ ts ; special commands for their selection . under editing Select the following commands for text selection are included :
&quot; this expanded meaning makes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; he@@ als the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also he@@ ats &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back @-@ line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to Edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for additional commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right before the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted surrounding commands , the operator can quickly lose sight of the lost environment . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly braces .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly braces of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted braces , braces can quickly be lost . this command complete the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple add @-@ on signs are used as alley for purposes . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple quotes is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two closing quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry for double @-@ entry characters can be set under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there can also be custom settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when moving Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; An intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; skip ; not only a line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , t &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with an end @-@ of @-@ line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to er@@ ase this . if this tab is not the corresponding one , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already offering a good source code completion , this has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for specific commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , there are five different modes built in . all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Settings box ... Complete files . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by means of the \ \ begin { environment } will &amp; box ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , unfortunately , the complete list appears . on the other hand , the list can also be res@@ ized by typing another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . as an alternative , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively by &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jumping trademarks may be used , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of Edit jump stamps N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste Bo@@ arding mark and the desired parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; under Pre@@ ferences box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; all actions can be made to these lists . it can be selected various possible lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ ins of the common language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . it is always necessary to enter a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of full support mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the surroundings are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when inv@@ oc@@ ation mode over the editing mode , or the key / key Alt + Shift key , the command can begin to open the environment automatically and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient support can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this has been completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be merged . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box , set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete files can be made to these lists . this mode uses the watch@@ list of the Rem@@ uner@@ ation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of sections , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... boxes can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , contains the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word rever@@ ber@@ ation mode over the editing process or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar is introduced , the letter L will be replaced with the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string . &quot;
&quot; large capacity keepers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many ters are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all previously written documents . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set in the menu box ... Ki@@ le Complete files . here , the threshold value can also be specified for viewing the completion . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / complete / mode / complete / mode / complete / mode / complete / mode / complete / mode . mode is for abbrevi@@ ation , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics simplify the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for descriptions and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to view the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating conver@@ sions and creating opinion . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling source code for viewer as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the second conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed by Alt ; 4 by Alt ; 4 ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when the quick construction is used , a viewer is usually called after the compilation . if no viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
&quot; a new project is being asked about the project &quot; &quot; Neues Projekt . &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the following information is asked for the project : &quot;
&quot; when defining the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file . &quot;
script function by &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed in vertical bar scripts .
&quot; the API scripts have not yet been developed , and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
first it has to be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids for support of users .
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ Live ; they are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; a complete ref@@ us@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ â grow@@ l &apos; . it is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , containing a database with all the documents and for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
a double click with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ be and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project by which &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random signatures , any signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; through many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day signatures , for the whole day the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a new signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section ; click the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your signature in the bottom section . signature example Kon@@ qi Kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click the disk icon Save . &quot;
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally ; there are always enough signatures .
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User @-@ defined button at the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination . &quot;
to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command .
&quot; all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower the frame number . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking a call in the displayed list , the cur@@ sor is placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot;

&quot; if the In@@ sp@@ ection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ u@@ gging In@@ spi@@ racy ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the source tab in the dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; file source files embedded in the &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
selecting a source entry in the shown list puts the text cur@@ sor in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the In@@ sp@@ ection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ u@@ gging In@@ spi@@ racy ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click the source tab in the dialog . &quot;
all found templates are listed here . note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T are valid ; therefore several templates can be available with the same match and mode details .
selecting a template contribution in the shown list will move the text cur@@ sor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a map in the dialog X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g @-@ In@@ spec@@ tor . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code in which a global and a local variable is declared
&quot; by clicking a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a specific expression , for example &quot;
&quot; then , a new X@@ Path can be selected by typing a new value for the variable expression and clicking on the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a variable entry in the list , the text cur@@ sor will be placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows me pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the ge@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted each time m@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical user interface . &quot;
&quot; if the recently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , it is easy to select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check option . &quot;
&quot; to use one &amp; DT@@ D file specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D file . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is required to specify the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file . &quot;
&quot; enter the file name , as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in its home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we &apos;ll start editing plu@@ gins . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the plug @-@ ins contained and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the information of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose who he is from the list of team members . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and clicking the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold by which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in regard to news and comments . see further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the team members : it can create an event for information to the team leader when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone works on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will insert a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the site Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Pre@@ ferences Di@@ alo@@ ges , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
you can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or add the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
&quot; comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nick@@ name of the introduced nick@@ name of the team member is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader In the area and sub@@ project lad@@ ders , the corresponding area or sub@@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ esis and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are handled , a short description for the other can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting up the Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including auto @-@ completion , can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; big / lower @-@ case by tags : large / lower @-@ write of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are written in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; big / lower case @-@ sensitive attributes : upper / lower case sensitive attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; automatically close the optional Tags : when checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , it is inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ; &quot;
not unlock optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the easy tags .
&quot; automatically update start and finish day : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of accents : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e types for the detection of different types of files . using button Standard can restore the default settings .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways than opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here is om@@ itted from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is sto@@ cked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; create backup copies on a regular basis , so that during a power failure or crash the next start of the program will restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; previ@@ ew@@ ing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or sag@@ ging of views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
the location to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree can be automatically opened while editing and how deep when changing the structure tree . empty knots are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause termin@@ ates something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plu@@ gins can be managed here . plu@@ gins are part @-@ applications of third party , which can be re @-@ used by each part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
loading Compon@@ ent in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plugin : if this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . drop off allows saving the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as of version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been dis@@ continued , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is produced , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Start the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include files . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next , as if there was not the current one . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more work of Keith .
this chapter describes how to use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic links to insert more quickly into a document than one user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a typing error . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and borders is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain anything as a single element of itself . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class . the name of the class class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for Type method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
&quot; speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to review the Tag@@ XML files is the Tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start the window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions will follow .
&quot; this feature is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&quot; the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it , reachable via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = move 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut that has been assigned to this action . by clicking on the User @-@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current key short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when performing the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus may be sent to the standard input . in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
select text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the standard output message . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create their own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit day &quot; when available to allow an input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green usually appears as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled to a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will insert ; -@@ day in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions specify ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the Apply button and continue with other tags , as there are some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar and set dialog via settings tool@@ bars . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the tool bar to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the Tren@@ ner support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like best . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might be in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has already done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top Element = func@@ 1 , func@@ 2 , tag@@ 1 , day 2 , day 3 func@@ 1 = func@@ .@@ html daily 2 = day 3.@@ html daily &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t influence anything but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files .
&quot; the content section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to design context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP ; script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . by checking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . &quot;
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separated resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places , there is a menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team regards them as correct and useful for publishing . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked about your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialog New Resource you have to fill out the input fields ( URL preview may remain empty ) and with clicking OK , upload the upload . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , checks &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . choose the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type Tag : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to gain full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , and is available . from tool@@ bars to actions everything is saved as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that only that user can use them personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ gn@@ ates the common usage of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all tab , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as the basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , help the word under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or open the file , if the string under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste in your document , then click on the icon representing the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in various fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; building man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with card holders , for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides . this view displays all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree will open . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ a@@ geable attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system , which is geared to the content , allows the change of all the available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . it can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , where useful information can be reached : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab displays all errors in the up @-@ to @-@ date mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( if there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files to your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before its bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a host of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; well already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what already somebody else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted action , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , it converts special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Search , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ interpreted by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag . &quot;
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the Shift ; button .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script sends error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and switching of the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries forecasts or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there , allowing , for example , to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; off and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
&quot; settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar , which only creates the name . actions need to be saved by setting actions ... Edit tool bars are stored by tool@@ bars tool bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see also . &quot;
load one &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refresh@@ ed without updating the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the shop will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion using tool@@ bar is denied if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules in this location .
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the version ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
al@@ ig@@ ns the editor &apos;s behavior . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add which ones and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as e.g. after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you process local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ mod@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default , templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are supposed to be included . if a project is started anew from scratch , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection of good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks , or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard comprises three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or by Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the Project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set using the Options button .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Team Con@@ figuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ specified event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select Project ... from the Project menu or the icon Project Open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before you exit , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folders also behave , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only more one profile is present , the button is da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the user . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk does not matter . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply listening to the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project tool@@ bar menu , accessible via settings tool@@ bars project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your own working method . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best stack@@ ed above the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is discussed below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols on this can be set using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , and other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will also remove action and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the Settings menu ... and set settings actions .
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions that one imag@@ ines for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; delivered templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
&quot; binary templates are usually included in documents by linking ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree on global templates . for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree , please refer to the template tree . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate .... &quot;
&quot; once this has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files tree view , you can click on a folder on the right and select site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . they can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically integrate with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them to them . additionally , you can keep a lot of things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
template structure in sub@@ windows templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder to select the behavior of a folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as par@@ ental Attri@@ butes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except the root folders in the template index . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would be explicitly enabled in this path . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ brick . if nothing appears , one probably finds itself in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; this may be generic he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , and allows to print a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command file for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which are accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second is the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ alu@@ able of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code editor is still needed . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the cur@@ sor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is running synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 enables this mode to move the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able using settings Qu@@ anta . by choice of V@@ PL ; view , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose document properties . thus , editing invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons down or removed . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external c@@ ss style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of cur@@ sors is possible as in a word processor , due to moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and can be deleted using button or removal key . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it should be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags previously does not remove already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor @-@ tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars like the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen Wi@@ zard will be disabled . later , they will work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . unlike other style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style sheet can be pursued .
&quot; in order to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need only lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries that are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a file name without path@@ name . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style sheet file name with rel@@ ativ@@ em path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible :
&quot; in this command , it is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template corresponds to any QNAP that contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a required holding point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer has changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in merging . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed inside these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was to compare and merge folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
&quot; this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge the complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often need to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more irritation when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ ders 2 Fol@@ ders 2 Fol@@ ders 2 Fol@@ ders 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; the opening dialog enables manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog shows your selection and shows them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files . &quot;
&quot; click the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not mandatory to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start merging / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
note : currently you cannot move anything out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping of text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , then a small help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , you see at the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merging ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . if differences are found , the color shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column of the text is interrupted in places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the wording edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons for the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be resolved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manually editing ; then , in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No row in the source file ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your opinion , and maybe paste another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , or in any mark you might copy and insert somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if you select Ign@@ ore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , page , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the abstra@@ cts will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window is explained ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar includes seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture up@@ side / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Move Up / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ above ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , conflict between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ inser@@ tion ) . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use chari@@ ot return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end@@ ings of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically during loading , and restored at the next start . ( set menus - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) &quot;
&quot; select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also places fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , there will be differences in itali@@ c script . if the chosen font doesn &apos;t support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered faith@@ fully . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically create an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press enter or return , the previous line will also be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board automatically . manually copying to the cli@@ p@@ board is no longer necessary . &quot;
you can choose which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , try to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when merging , white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a drive sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others can only see a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . comments in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when the selected file is used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are handled in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
change this option does not affect the current program . you will need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
over the selection fields for the encoding appears a short note of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands . &quot;
disable this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ oring C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences will be displayed in a color coded Over@@ view column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
sometimes you &apos;d rather use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply remove the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files together . merging the current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default file name . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be given to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; use this pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . thus , a pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines is required , which removes the automatically generated text : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi cleared . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and merging , and other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and , in the worst case , destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete directories recur@@ sively and merge . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simulate the merging and show the simulated changes without actually performing them ;
... carries out selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start merging , you must select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will learn a small message panel about current progress . if you break down the folder , only the files that have been compared until then are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
every file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded up . you can un@@ fold a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about any problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; however , in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . with folders the age is irrelevant for its color .
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copying of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copying of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist the merge operation cannot be started .
synchron@@ ize mode is enabled if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are syn@@ cing active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B according to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and beats the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the same date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; when merging , a file is executed after the other . it shows skill when the merge was successful , and correspon@@ dingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , it will be used as a destination in Three @-@ Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge Mode , and B and / or B will be used as a destination when synchron@@ izing A and / or B . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries : select the merge command start / continue in the Invent@@ ory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . in order to only merge the current item , select Run the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that points to the defective items . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the Browse , Simulation and Canc@@ el options . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform specific actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then proceed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them later . even if the merging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( set menu settings - &gt; K@@ adv@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ os@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in default . &quot;
&quot; links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ sample . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ gel@@ ation date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the confidentiality of the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this will be considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is presum@@ ed that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also affect the normal merge of single files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; usually , the merge command remains visible when merging single files ; you can move the divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can turn off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views using a change between the directory and text window . &quot;
&quot; you may want to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly , without having to start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be differentiated whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of trust of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P will always start the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3 part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally it needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file contains a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view into - K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and a menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s called compact ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ adv@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ us@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if similar lines appear next to each other , this is often the case . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking into the source text and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information . &quot;
you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; no sr@@ c is left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this purpose .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; in order to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
&quot; for information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot;
&quot; for a list of the latest changes , see ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package . &quot;
&quot; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir prints the folder in your system , where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; only Show Differ@@ ences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the Fol@@ der with the Update function after modifications to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain those files , they will be missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the labeled A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button again . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , quit or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop as well as on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and end . if , however , to an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu will also appear as well as the entries Minim@@ izing , Maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and End . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is displayed along with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ road@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , how from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical row display in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their contents and move . moreover , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent select of switches can be set up ... allows dialog settings to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . If you do not have any write permission for the file , you must login as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to it . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; enlarge part of the screen , as if you read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image displayed in the magni@@ fication window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in default , increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the cur@@ sor is shown in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor position . please note that this &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse @-@ po@@ inter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , press the &amp; M@@ b , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts / stops the update of the display . stopping the update means that the required CPU time runs against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and shrink &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you can use a magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for various people : from research , artists to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / K@@ mag ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter stays on the same spot for a while . it is thought to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury @-@ Syndrome ) and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick causes pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter remains in the same place . it is thought to help people who are suffering from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick causes pain . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain that is associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify this once more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by mouse clicks , it is useless . and as with all ergonomic means of aid : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and displays a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button emul@@ ates . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
this residence time must submit after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
&quot; when Intel@@ ligent Move On is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is stopped , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait , before dropping the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . this movement is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ ke@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to reduce response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System , and click here the tab General . there is a slider Sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , becomes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last user pressing . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with pres@@ ets . in particular , you should not let the smart move off at first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can do a mouse click . by doing so , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front rows of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible in this way to select text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you are just starting to use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will pop up every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so , you know exactly when the shift time starts when you are intelligent . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ review extension needs to be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should already be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor wa@@ its . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to num@@ b the mouse buttons .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a drag process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping with the mouse can also be done . &quot;

&amp; mouth ; is a program that lets silent users talk to their computers for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose from a list of the conversation history sets , which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command later used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the Setup Guide . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pas@@ time book . from the text passages , you can often select used text passages without having to type them . text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the vocabulary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org glos@@ sary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically a input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a flow memory of the already spoken words ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have mouth ; properly set , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the flow memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two cards , speech output and settings , page word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed on to the language generator . &quot;
mouth ; knows two ways to share the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as the default input .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications will provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a passage of text , you can determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text pas@@ time menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the chosen passage of the text is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the flow memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , closing the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text message book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pas@@ time records , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text@@ book folder will not be saved . select Before Save En@@ ter , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ time book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word supplement page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary on the input field and in the selection field . &quot;
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; the frequency of the individual words is easily determined by counting the occurrence . additionally you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are combined , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add new words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of the text or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ time book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; you can add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise select the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise select the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is arranged by default through the editing window under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the flash@@ card speech output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for voice output setting , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the voice output configuration , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eri@@ de folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the Free@@ T@@ TS application . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swallow the last sign of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complicated than in the other examples : &quot;

all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option must be turned on as a default input .
the Voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s .
&quot; since the language generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( plus memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; mouth ; is an application , with people who cannot speak , to send text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences will be stored , which the user can always make new editions . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer included . a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on your computer .
&quot; you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar , or launch k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
read text ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
&quot; speech output takes place via speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows to generate voice output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&amp; k@@ de voice @-@ over@@ s ; an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configur@@ ing and setting kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; with which a text file can be read whole or in part .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa data base of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find discussions about the section called ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ level@@ . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ level@@ er ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set it right . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of t@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the map card is displayed . see also . if you have at least set up a speaker , the card card is displayed in general . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise the default speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; when you click the Spe@@ ak Regi@@ stered Spe@@ aker in kt@@ m@@ gr , the card holder will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker . &quot;
all the speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred actors appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker on the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
&quot; on any of these buttons , click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system . &quot;
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the map and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to create text orders and manage them . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start the language evaluation system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab labeled General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ t ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create text orders and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ m@@ gr is finished , it runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; next , if the field is enabled to activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ mot@@ h@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar while reading , it will disappear again as soon as the advance reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start , break , stop and record text orders . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card orders are only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the tab labeled General and tick language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ t ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the Advanced Text Editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can pre @-@ read the displayed text . then check the text you want to read , and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which noti@@ fies you about the events you set . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ops ; read more . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation , for example , to set up a message where your nick@@ name occurs in an IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the here possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ according to application . &quot;
&quot; filter for string replacement offers a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ t ; incorrect or incorrect messages to be corrected . the file k@@ mail .x@@ ml , which belongs to &amp; kt@@ t &apos;s scope of supply , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ t ; for normal work with &amp; tal ; filters are not required .
&quot; filters are processed before being sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , in order to replace wrong spoken words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass specific short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders on . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning will take preced@@ ence and keep the output of messages and normal text .
&quot; news is the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text read on a website , you can say with &amp; k@@ mouth ; al@@ erts are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ t ; just one of them reads , this issue is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be other types of filters .
&quot; string plac@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . they can either be used as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; is provided with pre@@ defined string @-@ tags filters , which enable the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ t ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the map for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ t ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the normal filters equipped . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are de@@ activated from the top down . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will display the following setup di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; for the creation of string translation filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged against the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column consistency and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copy . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if all input fields are empty . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
in this manual you will not find a manual for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the parcel box .
&quot; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such res@@ hap@@ ing . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the voice selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map or@@ ator , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; after ; a text to the filter passes , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the narr@@ ator features which the program proposes , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ t ; sends , and the properties of the speaker established on the card menu , you can over@@ ride the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can click on the button to receive help during input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialogue message selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter set up , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . also , make sure the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and find the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so entire sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sh is output . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are any problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string of string replacement filters . &quot;

speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ t ; have their own license which you can find in the associated documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices which have their own license .
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it from it . in addition , you can find the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the Synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the cap@@ itali@@ zation packages and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ t ; from the source code archive , or download the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , first check if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ t ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual phrases . the user can return pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph styles , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , an application may request a female English speaker . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the best suited speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker will choose , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Add Spe@@ aker on Add , and in order to add a speaker into the list or click Edit , the Kart@@ ei@@ karte A Spe@@ aker Setup is shown below . for example , below is the setup of the module for Festival Inter@@ active . for details on the modules you will find under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . if votes , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting will be made automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider controls , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this gray , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is shown kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ mot@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible after start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to see the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ mot@@ h@@ gr will not run , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise steer . &quot;
&quot; all orders in the queue are listed here , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can proceed or go back in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; text orders are listed and managed here . screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ t , see . &quot;
&quot; select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ t ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 % corresponds to about half and 200@@ rpm , for example the double normal speech speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text read on a website , you can say with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output to the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and spending of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start t@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card message appears al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ t ; reads no al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played is from &amp; kt@@ t ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioning your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ t ; ignored . &quot;
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what you want to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected a user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the features of the subscri@@ ber . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map or@@ ator as top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . to do so you can set the default messages as follows :

SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
&quot; you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice that uses the festival at the output of SS@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ g ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and syntax high@@ lighting filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds support text into single sentences . this allows you to start and stop faster with the preview , because only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also pre @-@ skip or stop orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker &apos;s selection by trying out . switch off the selection of speakers and select text to read . check the voice selection , change some properties , and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . you naturally need to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function , you can stop text orders on the card card . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal typing error filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
syntax high@@ line filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set boundaries ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default syntax high@@ code filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal typing error filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ t . &quot;
&quot; on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Map , you can over@@ ride the Spe@@ aker settings for the application . &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the card holder ) . in other words : no spokesperson properties are specified .
&quot; use the most appropriate speaker with all the features of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ t ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ t ; the speaker , who most likely corresponds to the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the required speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; select here the properties of the speaker you want . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other features . you can also set several markers here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the area announ@@ cer , the most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker button and then use speaker that matches most of the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ale m@@ gr ki@@ cks off immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ t ; has been terminated . most likely you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA occur that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / kt@@ ts@@ d / vulner@@ ability . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the intercom card . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting from &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml converter filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival doesn &apos;t produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file acc@@ uses to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added an own string of string translation filters and now I can proceed in &amp; out ; no more set @-@ up or going back . orders are displayed on the cart@@ on ; the order only consists of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; you are not allowed to filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for the prec@@ inct detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ t ; the command line register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ asp@@ net@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users are experiencing conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . moreover , if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks yet . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ t , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can then install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a folder . &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have run@@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian Distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you will have to pass --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example : &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from sources . &quot;
CD k@@ not to echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; inst @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use it , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
you have to install at least one language . help you find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites you need to install the ( male UK ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these votes you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software to festival / li@@ b / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must vote for the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions , so search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R for example . &quot;
&quot; festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA , synthes@@ izer and then takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from phon@@ o files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates these by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder &quot; &quot; festival / li@@ b / . instructions &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . it is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , it is not necessary to re@@ compile the error correction , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 2 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / soli@@ di@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just insert the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices are not working with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to provide the language via festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work . then download festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program tar to a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file must be in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech synthes@@ izer generates sound . the voice quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ale m@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA file .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ osed speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; tal ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;

&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ p speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can set neither pitch , volume nor speech speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf@@ . , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf@@ ers the device at all and allows setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this device tries to automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which of the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and is best . by checking the non @-@ re @-@ ask setting , the definition can be set dur@@ ably . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , click the button System Administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , all the functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider &apos;s network interfaces :
&quot; the settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button &quot; &quot; Interface &quot; ... &quot; in the dialog device to be edited . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be set without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is un@@ desirable , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . switching on an off @-@ off network device will be activated by selecting from the list , and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating interface .... &quot;
&quot; sets the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if more than one network interface exists on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain information by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org calls , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list using the Hin@@ di or Her@@ in buttons . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from batch machines to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click on the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from batch machines to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There will be dialog Edit . &quot;
&quot; the list Name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of name @-@ known computers contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this is still in the test to replace version 4 in the future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... Add new alias dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click on the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press de button Add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
&quot; select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list , and select Edit .... The dialog familiar to the machine will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but additionally , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users , but it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf@@ . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second one will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf@@ using configuration files . &quot;
this section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . this app@@ endi@@ x contains only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently concentrating on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point to use a valid IP address or , if available , can use D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a field reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for IP for@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has been assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit . &quot;
this part contains the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is referred to random by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . a different stand than expected may therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; the default box appears ; -@@ Print dialog . if you select shut@@ down , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change user schedules . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ SIX con@@ formal &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which additionally provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ inst@@ ate the band and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the clamp on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is supposed to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be re @-@ created . &quot;
&quot; if everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed through the entry of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be recognized by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any risk . &quot;
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not require format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat , but does not require format@@ ting before using the tape . flo@@ ppy drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , however , DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , proceed with format@@ ting the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after the format@@ ting process has been completed , the tape will automatically be integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the menu Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Veri@@ fy ....
&quot; once the check@@ out has been started , the dialog box will appear for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for review . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can start restoring , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box will appear for restoration . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog appears again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
&quot; as a result , a backup profile will be created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be watched will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all files listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file against tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files have not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat , to lock the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the tape will automatically be ki@@ cked off when resol@@ ving &amp; k@@ dat . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat , to change the hard@@ war@@ y block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not involve incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users to understand what makes your machine in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system tables the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to provide quick access to , for example , information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the sy@@ slo@@ g server format and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which the individual log lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if this is not displayed , and it opens instead of a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected string . enter a string into the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will appear next to the filter . then , a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is contained . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , also select another entry . the string of the filter search term is then checked with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so you can show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the Level Note . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
&quot; if you only want to display a particular process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the To @-@ New lines option in the main window context menu to display all new protocol rows . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web@@ page on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know anything about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re @-@ installation and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which only starts once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; on your part , r@@ c.@@ local should be on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up , then you can fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and running the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does all the scripts then start ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line , like this : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level , which only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; runs . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( resp@@ . stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between run@@ time , or alter the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the domain of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to recover records that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before running . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ time levels , and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ Level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
if you use Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simply simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without a message , if their configuration files are not available or configured in@@ correctly . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ ting &amp; k@@ user ; &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either you can use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings . other cards may appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d may be installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the map card password management appears if shadow passwords , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card map only appears if space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( recognizable by the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limited space limitations in the KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation .
&quot; the flash@@ card groups inform about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by marking them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s properties include a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user / group works an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boat manager to add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change , and more . &quot;
